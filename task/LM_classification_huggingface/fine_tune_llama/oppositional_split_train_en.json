The Bill will get a second reading on Friday 6th May 2022 . I agree with Sir Christopher wholeheartedly - the Government is ignoring those injured and bereaved by the Covid - 19 \u201c vaccines \u201d and there is a need for a new vaccine injury bill . Sir Christopher \u2019s speech included the following points : \" \" No payments have yet been made . . . even in respect of those whom a coroner \u2019s verdict found to have died because of the vaccine . The impatience and frustration of those so affected is now palpable . Having lost their loved ones more than a year ago , some have been badgering the Under - Secretary of State for Health and Social Care , my Hon Friend the Member for Lewes [ Maria Caulfield ] , for action \u2014 I am pleased to see her on the Front Bench . I understand that yesterday she blocked vaccine victims on her Twitter account and today she closed her Twitter account completely . This is an indication of the strength of feeling among the public . \u201d \" \" Those who were in perfect health before their vaccine have encountered too much ignorance and scepticism when seeking medical help . For some , their general practitioner has refused to engage , to the extent that they are made to feel gaslighted , with their physical pain being dismissed or explained away as mental illness . How insulting and humiliating is that and how at odds with the principles of the national health service ? \u201d The \" \" Coronavirus vaccine - weekly summary of the Yellow Card Reporting \u201d ( https :// www . gov . uk / government / publications / coronavirus - covid - 19 - vaccine - adverse - reactions / coronavirus - vaccine - summary - of - yellow - card - reporting ) which I trust you are familiar with provides details of yellow card reports - each week more adverse events and deaths are reported . Through an organisation , UK Citizen , I am aware of two hundred and fifty ( 250 ) formal Covid - 19 vaccine injury statements been made and subsequently lodged with the police . In addition there were many more people who came forward to share their experience of vaccine injury and bereavement , but who were not comfortable filing a formal witness statement . The gaslighting of the Covid - 19 \u201c vaccine \u201d injured and bereaved must stop . The public should have been told , at the outset , that the Covid - 19 \u201c vaccines \u201d were ( and are ) experimental and remain in clinical trial . This did not happen , \u201c informed consent \" \" was consequently not possible - the Government failed the public . Subsequently , the Government used coercive methods to get the public to take the Covid - 19 \u201c vaccines \u201d in contravention of the principles of public service as enshrined in the Nolan Principles . Now the Government is failing to recognise that there are adverse effects from the \u201c vaccines \u201d - this is simply unconscionable . The Government must make the public aware of the risks involved in taking the Covid - 19 \u201c vaccines \u201d ; be transparent about injuries and deaths ; and provide care and compensation for those injured or bereaved . Clause 1(2)(a ) of the Bill provides that the review must consider the effectiveness of MHRA in the monitoring of side effects and the NHS and Government response to such monitoring - it is evident from everything stated above that such a review is vital .

EVER ! \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Hail to all of the brave and wonderful members of our White Rose global community ! As the situations and conditions in the world , The Great Reset , and the strategies of the globalists shift in order to manifest the New World Order , we need to be ever vigilant to realize that until this information war is completely won , and that all people everywhere are made aware of the full extent of the battle which we all face , which means a piercing knowledge of the plans and means for Globalism , International Banking , and all the other tools used by these satanic occult black magicians who have ruled us by stealth and hidden knowledge , kept from us , since the beginning of recorded history . The decline and retreat of the COVID narrative , is just another fleeting moment in this greater battle for Liberty on the Earth , and as long as we have all of these oppressive and deceitful governments above us that seem to think that it is their right to rule us , and that they somehow have the \" authority \" to rule us , then our brand of Truth media , stickers , and this community , will continue to be needed . As long as there are lies being put forth by any \" official \" agencies , then The White Rose will be a powerful and vital force to help disseminate the counter narratives , and to help spread the Truth across the world . In an effort to keep ourselves growing and relevant , as these times progress , we may want to shift our focus somewhat to other aspects of Truth and Liberty free speech . The definition of freedom of speech , as put forth by the American founding fathers is this : \" The free and public expression of opinions without censorship , interference , and restraint by the government \" . We clarify this here , as there is some disagreement as to what \" free speech \" means . As long as there exists any mask or vaccine mandates ANYWHERE , then the need for the stickers that help illuminate the lies surrounding the COVID narrative will be a powerful weapon of Truth . However , when the battle retreats and it seems that we have had a victory , then we should be able and willing to shift gears at a moment 's notice to put up stickers that pertain to highlighting and other Globalist lies that threaten to oppress us . We must be ever ready to shift our focus and tactics to adapt to and overcome any disinformation that is put in front of We The People . This may entail local stickers and local action to combat the ideas and deceptions put forth by more local politicians , and should be adaptable to any situation , depending on your own decentralized and personal idea about what is important to engage in order to manifest individual freedom , as our members feel is needed . As always , while doing these kinds of stickers , we should strive to uphold the ideas and spirit of the mission statement , and embody general principles of freedom , sovereignty , self ownership of body and speech , inalienable Natural Rights for all humans everywhere , and the Voluntaryist ideal that all interactions between humans ought to be voluntary , between sovereigns , and not under the whims and dictates of any who claim that they have the authority to dictate to free humans what actions they may , or may not take , as long as the Natural Rights of others are respected and protected . The only legitimate function of government is to uphold and defend these rights , deriving their just powers ONLY from the consent of the governed .

It is awful to see people forced into battle and being tortured , maimed and killed due to the actions of political leaders who have neglected their ultimate duty to protect the citizens of their countries . Make no mistake though - - the war that is unfolding between Ukraine and Russia is being used by the media and partisan hacks to continue a much more sinister plot to divide and ostracize entire groups of people , to remove them from the world stage , and to promote the coalition of a one world government that ultimately will usher in the antichrist . The same people that spoon fed lies about the covid - 19 pandemic , demanded national vaccines in order to work , and who have engaged in the muzzling of our youth , and the widespread cultural cancellation of opposing opinions are now eager to bring down Vladamir Putin and the entire country of Russia while uniting around the \u201c sovereign \u201d nation of Ukraine . If nothing else , we must pause and ask ourselves some important questions . Anyone who has released the depth of corruption taking place in America and around the world must at least wonder whether the narrative being promoted now by our media should all of a sudden be taken as gospel truth . Obviously no one wants to see people being murdered , cities being bombed , and countries at war , but can we pause and take a moment to seperate our emotional reactions and outrage at what is unfolding ? Let \u2019s examine the cause , the purpose , and the potential for a greater and more sinister plan on the part of the globalist kabul . Our media did n't label the US as an ' evil invader ' when they brutally invaded Iran , Iraq , Syria , Afghan and others . Why ? Because according to our media it was n't an invasion , it was the US ' liberating them with our democracy ' ... , to the tune of drone strikes and destruction for thousands . And for those who have seen the lies the media are capable of producing on a mass scale for so long .. What changed now ? It 's the same companies . Controlled by the same bloodlines and organizations . For the same purposes . To divide , increase polarity , and cause chaos . From this chaos , they create ' order ' , orchestrated by , among others , Klaus Scwab from the World Economic Forum . What if I told you that Russia is one of the only countries whose leader has publicly called out the World Economic Forum , and said that he does n't want to take part in the new world order . Now does it make sense why the media and globalist elites like George Soros have been hellbent on destroying Putin ? You probably have seen the images of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in military gear , or graphic footage of children saying goodbye to their parents , or what about the picture of the same guy who apparently died twice ( once in Syria to justify that invasion , and now again in Ukraine ) , or how about a Ukrainian fighter pilot shooting down Russians ? What If I told you these images being promulgated across mainstream media platforms are actually completely fake ? Movie clips , archived images , and photoshopped graphics .. Modern war propaganda being disseminated by our \u201c trusted \u201d news companies that brought you the Russian Collusion narrative , the phony impeachment scandal , and the Covid - 19 mass hysteria lies ? All of a sudden we should now trust what they are sharing ? ? History Lesson : Did you know that Russia essentially started in Ukraine and for a long time the capital was known as ' the cradle of Russia ' ? Or that a large percentage of Ukrainians identify as Russian , and have wanted liberation from the overreach of the EU for decades ? Remember \u2026 there is ALWAYS more to the story ! But why lie , right ? The current CIA - approved , media peddled narrative wants you to believe that Vladamir Putin seeks to reassemble the old Soviet Union and will move next to capture the Baltic States : Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania .

But consider those doctors continuing to exercise discernment and attempting to walk the razor \u2019s edge between treating and informing their patients as they see fit , without going so against their regulatory body that they are suspended and then unable to treat patients at all . This has become an almost impossible task in most countries \u2013 and completely impossible in some . As I mentioned previously , my dear friend and ally Dr Mark Trozzi was effectively forced out of his job as an excellent ER physician because he could not comply with measures that he knew would do his patients harm . I know many doctors currently under investigation by their regulatory bodies for doing the right thing : whether this be voicing their concerns about risks of Covid - 19 vaccinations , or administering off - label treatments such as Ivermectin because they considered it the best treatment for their patient . Some doctors are managing to continue their work by speaking out while remaining anonymous . One such is a UK GP who writes a blog called The Covid Physician . This offers a first - hand account of what it \u2019s like to be a doctor in the midst of a pandemic when all around you are compliant and you are quietly rebelling . We turn to the law when all other avenues have failed , and we rely on good lawyers to represent our case so that our rights may be upheld and protected . However , I am learning that we do not need to rely on others when we are empowered with the knowledge of our inalienable rights and the law . Speaking of the law \u2026 please join me this Sunday for Tess Talks with Professor Dolores Cahill . I am thrilled to have had the chance to spend time with Professor Dolores Cahill , who has been at the forefront of fighting for medical freedom and sovereignty from the very beginning . Dolores speaks so eloquently about the law , and how our legal system is not , in fact , lawful . What really struck me from our conversation was how we are led to believe the law is horribly complicated , but it \u2019s actually beautifully simple . I spoke of the basic tenet of the law in last week \u2019s Substack article \u2013 that of \u2018 Act in honour , do no harm . \u2019 If you \u2019re wondering how it \u2019s even possible that the legal system can be unlawful , then you need to listen to Dolores . Listening to her drove home to me that understanding the law in its glorious simplicity is the key to our personal and collective freedom . Our conversation will be posted on my Substack Sunday morning , so stay tuned .

Get a piece of paper and write down CIA and other intel agencies in a box and timeline . In November 2018 the NSA & MIL Intel took control over the CIA and it 's partnered intelligence agencies . CIA / Mossad and FVEYS intelligence agencies .. For Australians ASIO is a part of FVEY . Every leader in the world President , Prime Minister , King or Queen must STAND DOWN this includes President Trump . Do n't worry he will be back . Once he makes it official ( His big decision coming ) then we have to have elections within 120 days . It is here where we elect governmentS 10 % the size of what we have now . We will never have Democrat vs Republican or Liberal vs Labour again . Under GESARA we get scrubbed back to original constitutions and sitting leaders will be in power for as long as they want , til death or they do wrong . If they do wrong by the people they get removed by Military . Now draw a line from the Vatican to the Rothschilds Banking System ( Central Banks & Federal Reserve ) The Rothschilds own the Vatican and it 's bank . Now we have a massive Operation in Europe called OPERATION : DEFENDER EUROPE . This started on March 17 2020 . This is taking control of the Vatican , it 's Mafia 's and seizing all of the Rothschilds Central Banks . There is some Central Banks ie Riksbank in Sweden , Europe Central Bank and Deutsche Bank who had casualties of Coronavirus . Draw a line from Intel Agencies to Royal Family and write March 2019 . The Royal Family are the owners of all of these Intelligence agencies . They own the CIA . They own all of FVEY . They created the Mossad in Israel and they created the Saudi Intel as well . Now the Royal Family QE1 & QE2 are of Germanic Origin . They created World Wars with the higher ups too . They stole all the opium from the Middle East and Asian Wars . ( Vietnam & Korea ) using their intel agencies and would supply the Vatican Mafia 's with Opium to turn it into Heroin and supply the world . These Intel Agencies create Terror Organisations , Terror Attacks & False Flag Attacks . They participate in all kinds of Trafficking . Drugs , Children , Bombs or whatever else .. So Adolf Hitler was a Rothschild . When the war ended they smuggled he and 12000 Nazi 's to Argentina as part of Operation : Paperclip . Also who you know to be the ' BUSH \" family are really the SCHERF family of Germany . George Bush Senior served in the German Navy and he was smuggled along with a Nazi Assassin to the USA with the MK ULTRA mind control program . So that was a brief outline of what the Royal Family have done . So in March 2019 the USA had gone over and stripped all of the Royal Powers after the CIA was under full control . Next you want to draw a line from the Royal Family to the Vatican . The Vatican own the Royal Family . So in 2019 the Vatican was raided twice and you can search this . They also arrested 5 or 6 at top of the Vatican and also had arrested some Vatican Mafia . Just like in 1999 when military forced Bill Clinton to sign Nesara . The military forced Boris Johnson to get Brexit through . So what did Brexit really do ? It cut the strings to the Vatican . Once all these were well and truely under way .. In November 2019 the US Military went and stripped all of the Royal Assets . The USA now has complete ownership of the Commonwealth and intel agencies . Then in Feb 2020 Brexit becomes official . The Royals have officially been stripped from the Vatican ownership . So you can write down 3 dates here . Mid 2019 or the dates of Vatican raids November 2019 Royal Assets Stripped . Feb 2020 Brexit . You know how i just broke the process down . You found out the Royal Family controls the intel agencies . This includes Israeli Mossad and Saudi Arabia .. It was these guys and the German Bush / Scherff Family that created 9/11 .. ( Royal Family / Nazi ) attack on the USA to stop NESARA / GESARA and create another depopulating / Opium and Oil controlling war .

A study published 18 March 2022 shows sulforaphane , a chemical found in cruciferous vegetables , \" exhibits antiviral activity against pandemic SARS - CoV - 2 and seasonal HCoV - OC43 coronaviruses . \" \" Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) , has incited a global health crisis . Currently , there are limited therapeutic options for the prevention and treatment of SARS - CoV - 2 infections . We evaluated the antiviral activity of sulforaphane ( SFN ) , the principal biologically active phytochemical derived from glucoraphanin , the naturally occurring precursor present in high concentrations in cruciferous vegetables . SFN inhibited in vitro replication of six strains of SARS - CoV - 2 , including Delta and Omicron , as well as that of the seasonal coronavirus HCoV - OC43 . \" The study conducted by researchers at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine concludes \" Our results suggest that SFN should be explored as a potential agent for the prevention or treatment of coronavirus infections . \" \" Treatment with SFN increased phagocytic activity of alveolar macrophages and reduced lung injury in animal models of acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) . SFN also decreased the levels of IL - 6 and viral load in human subjects infected with live attenuated influenza virus . Numerous clinical trials utilizing SFN have demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetics after oral dosing and documented excellent tolerability and safety . \" Sulforaphane is a compound found in abundance in cruciferous plants , such as broccoli and broccoli rabe , kale , brussels sprouts , collard greens , cabbage , mustard greens , cauliflower , turnip and rutabaga , bok choy , watercress , kohlrabi , radish , horseradish , arugula and wasabi .   The Positive Takeaway We previously presented research showing black cumin seeds and foods containing shikimic acid stop the spike protein causing damage and stop cytokine storms - which is when affected immune systems over - respond , causing more damage . One WCH resource we posted on is a science - based guide to \" Optimize Your Natural Immune System , \" which emphasises the importance of healthy nutrition , sleep , rest , exercise , and routine de - stress practices to boost our health . Terrain theory explains that it is the quality of the terrain - or our internal environment - that determines an individual \u2019s susceptibility to disease . When the body is functioning in homeostasis , and immunity and detoxification are operating well , there is a healthy terrain which can handle external threats . We as free thinking people care about objective facts , so surely the most important objective facts are those that optimise our health - our mind , body and spirit ( inner resources ) . A new ( Mar 2 ) study compared the many known benefits of spending time in nature with our perception of our environment , concluding going into nature is more healing with a positive mindset , while putting our attention on negativity - focused news increases stress , anxiety and depression . e.g. the science says focusing on every new health concern that a Covid vaccine may cause is compromising our immunity , while developing simple habits that make us feel happy , healthy , empowered , strong and connect us to our our intuition make us immune to disease . The latest science in quantum mechanics also shows that what works individually also works collectively , and if we nurture a new positive worldview as a community , this happy , healthy post - Covid world will become a reality . The solution to mass formation is to be an example of how we want the world to be . Now is the time for us to act - to speak our truth , yes , but also be the example . Our focus at CPN is to create with you a new beautiful post - Covid world with or without current systems . If those systems in place do not wish to follow , we will leave them behind .

Usually you do it 3 times . ( At the first lockdown I said - watch out , there 'll be a 2nd and a 3rd ! ) This increases compliance - you 're much more likely to get them to do whatever you want .   A ' Yes ' set : Get them to say ' Yes ' to something small at first ( just two weeks to \" flatten the curve \" ) then gradually increase ( months of lockdown , Christmas cancelled , socially / economically coerced into vaccines ) . In this way they 're much more likely to keep saying yes . ( There would 've been riots if they 'd said in March lockdowns will carry on through Christmas . )   Confusion : Keep them in a constant state of uncertainty . The conscious mind responds to this by ' going offline ' as it searches for the appropriate response for something it has no precedent for . Then it 's much easier for the manipulator to gain access to the unconscious mind and change belief systems . For example , lockdown rules are changing on practically a day - to - day basis ; we 're living in a world we 've never lived in before , everyone 's stumbling about with no idea how to behave . We 've no energy left to fight our oppressors .   Repetition : Repeat the same information over and over ( see any newspaper / TV news for evidence of this ! )   Illusion of Choice Make them believe they 're in control by giving them 2 choices , both of which lead to the same result . For example , ' Do you want the Pfeizer or the Oxford ? ' or ' You can choose to be good or bad . Bad = more lockdown . Good = more lockdown .

The end of the pandemic due to a new virus and the transition to endemicity may be defined based on a high proportion of the global population having some immunity from natural infection or vaccination . Other considerations include diminished death toll , diminished pressure on health systems , reduced actual and perceived personal risk , removal of restrictive measures , and diminished public attention . A threshold of 70 % of the global population having being vaccinated or infected was probably already reached in the second half of 2021 . Endemicity may still show major spikes of infections and seasonality , but typically less clinical burden , although some locations are still hit more than others . Death toll and ICU occupancy figures are also consistent with a transition to endemicity by end 2021 / early 2022 . Personal risk for the vast majority of the global population was already very small by end 2021 , but perceived risk may still be grossly over - estimated . Restrictive measures of high stringency have persisted in many countries by early 2022 . The gargantuan attention in news media , social media , and even scientific circles should be tempered . Public health officials need to declare the end of the pandemic . Mid - and long - term consequences of epidemic waves and of adopted measures on health , society , economy , civilization , and democracy may perpetuate a pandemic legacy long after the pandemic itself has ended .

First , our nation was attacked by a Deep State bio - weapon with the help of foreign actors . Planned for many years . Then our national election ( which is critical infrastructure ) was cyber - attacked in 2020 by the Deep State with the help of foreign actors . Planned for at least 4 years . I believe January 6 was a Deep State attack with only a few foreign actors , if any . Planned I bet , for at least several weeks if not longer . Throughout , an information / disinformation attack by the Deep State with propaganda and PSYOPS carried out with the help of foreign actors . Planned for decades . What is next ? Only God knows . For us , only time will tell . Just be prepared for anything these days and press on one day at a time . Let \u2019s pray that our nation does not have to fight a physical attack on our soil with bullets and bombs . After all , as Sun Tzu said , \u201c The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting . \u201d Remember that sometimes in war , your perceived enemies become your allies when there is a common goal or objective . Always be aware of the enemy within . The most dangerous of ALL enemies . You must identify the enemy in order to defeat the enemy . The enemy is the Deep State . Learn who our specific enemies are , especially the online enemies in the information / disinformation battle . Identify who is the leader of the enemy in the digital war and identify his \u201c digital warriors . \u201d I pray our nation will defeat the Deep State which is controlled by the Illuminati . If we do , we will defeat the Illuminati and wrest control of our country away from the hands of a rich and powerful few and return it to We The People . Times are tough but in my opinion , this is a war worth fighting and a war worth the pain and suffering . Support our Commander In Chief , President Donald J. Trump . He is fighting for America and We The People . He always puts America First . Never play into the enemy \u2019s hands and lessen your support for our leader in a time of war . He needs We The People in order to prevail . Above all , trust God , grow your faith in Him . He is a God of War as well as a God of Love . God always wins .

It is so important that we complete this as currently there are very obvious omissions in the scope . Please visit the WEBPAGE of TOGETHER which aims to simplify the process for you and offer some guidance on points to raise . Please try to \u2018 individualise \u2019 your responses so that they are given more attention . * * * * One area that I would like to see covered in detail are care homes and the associated issues being : - 1 . There seems to have been a complete abrogation from best interests procedure in many cases for care home residents . Did this lead to excess deaths and/or suffering ? 2 . Was the DoLS procedure not followed correctly or at all in some cases ? Did local authorities break the law and commit the offence of false imprisonment ? Was this a widespread issue ? 3 . What are the Human Rights implications vis a vis preventing visits , preventing residents leaving care homes , having no DoLS in place . 4 . The use of blanket DNACPRs and associated human rights concerns 5 . It seems that safeguarding issues were not dealt with in a timely manner during the last 2 years , sometimes not at all . What effect has this had on residents and their quality of life , and indeed the family of residents . 6 . Were the elderly failed , despite the message of lockdown being that we were doing it for them ? Services for care homes were withdrawn for months at the start of lockdown . Did this lead to avoidable deaths ? Can we have an analysis of care home deaths during lockdown against 5 year average . There needs to be a similar exploration of issues 1 to 4 above for hospitals along with a frank discussion about the reintroduction of the Liverpool Care Pathway which we know happened from family witness testimony . I would also like the issue of death certificates and the relaxation of rules regarding cause of death looked at . Medical cert cause of death ( MCCD ) could be written up as Covid , if this was \" suspected \" , not proven . Did this lead to many death certificates being written up with the wrong cause of death , inflating covid numbers ? Was it best policy to remove the MCCD requirements or did this in fact place people at more risk , ( i.e. we will never know how many people died of bad care , poor practice , care home or hospital foul play etc , although the latter is rare ) . Other thoughts : - a ) why was there no full , open , and transparent debate by both sides over strategy . There were many eminent doctors and scientists who did not agree with SAGE and the govt . Why could their position not be aired and debated openly . Surely in a crisis you would ask the top experts to collaborate , not shut half of them out . The definition of science is testing and debating then altering your position as results emerge . b ) why , given current legislation which states that the UK does not have a mandatory vaccination policy , were mandates for care home workers allowed , and why were they attempted for NHS workers ? Why was it considered acceptable to crow bar this through by secondary legislation , not even primary ! What effect did the mandate have on care home staff and services and how is that playing out now ? c ) why was a risk benefit analysis about lockdown not conducted and made public ? How could such devastating policies be enacted without MPs ever considering their detriment . For instance , deaths at home during lockdown grossly exceeded the 5 year average . They were still trending high only a few weeks ago . Does this prove we harmed more than we saved ? d ) when we look at deaths for 2020 and 2021 , compared to the 5 year average , was there even such an excess as to warrant the use of the word pandemic ? Did we have a case pandemic , and do the numbers of deaths at home allude to excess deaths being made up by alot of the deaths at home ? e ) is it possible to measure what level the NHS operated at throughout lockdown , particularly the first part ? It does n't ever seem to have been overwhelmed .

This might come as a surprise to most people , especially considering that Sweden is one of few countries that have n't ordered a lockdown and where public schools are still open . According to data made public by The Swedish Intensive Care Registry ( Svenska intensivv\u00e5rdsregistret , SIR ) , Sweden saw a rise in newly omitted patients for intensive care due to the novel coronavirus and COVID - 19 on March 18th with 15 new admissions . The number of daily admissions continued rising until March 23rd , where 44 new admissions were made to intensive care due to COVID - 19 . But then something happened . The number of new admissions stabilized and even decreased until a new spike of 46 admissions on March 29th , which was followed by another two days with just 29 new admissions on March 31st . Sweden has seen a steady rise in new cases of the coronavirus , with a total of above 4500 cases with severe symptoms or in need of medical assistance . The number of admissions to intensive care tells us that Sweden might have been able to protect people in the risk groups , which , to a more significant extent , would need intensive care . Even though the number of new admissions to the ICU is decreasing , Sweden is still facing a tough challenge as the country in 2019 only had 526 ICU beds , many of them already occupied even before the novel coronavirus . The Swedish health department is now trying to extend the capacity but was ill - prepared for a pandemic because of the decade - long dismantling of Swedens emergency equipment . Critics say that the numbers from the SIR are either a result of hiding the actual numbers or that the intensive care stations already being full and therefore not accepting new admissions . There is also a question of whether all departments are reporting in time or if the statistics are lagging . Even if there are some legitimate questions about the statistics , we can see that at the moment , Sweden does n't have anything near the exponential growth of new admissions to intensive care that many were expecting , which is a positive . On the other hand , Swedens intensive care departments still expect to be full in a short time . Mainly because the patients needing intensive care over a long time , which means that they will occupy the beds while new cases are still pouring in . As an outlier in the fight against COVID - 19 many have their eyes on Sweden . And in a time of many commentators asking for more governmental restrictions and interferences in our daily life , Sweden 's example should be of interest to everyone . Will Sweden 's approach fail or succeed ? We do n't know yet , but the data so far tell us that the home of the vikings at least is n't doing much worse than others with fiercer restrictions .

The losses incurred in the Donbass ( during the assault on the next \" fortresses \" they will definitely be VERY HIGH ) will also need to be compensated somehow . In general , HOW will the Russian command be able to \" fend off \" the concentration of fresh formations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine , for example , on the borders of the Kursk and Belgorod regions in a month or two ? And if they go on the offensive , how will they be repelled ? Consolidated police detachments , detachments of \" Alco - Cossacks \" ( all real Cossacks are already at the front ) or the regional militia ? So it - the regional militia - has not even been created yet ! ! ! Nobody stutters ...

The Bill will get a second reading on Friday 6th May 2022 . I agree with Sir Christopher wholeheartedly - the Government is ignoring those injured and bereaved by the Covid - 19 \u201c vaccines \u201d and there is a need for a new vaccine injury bill . Sir Christopher \u2019s speech included the following points : \" \" No payments have yet been made . . . even in respect of those whom a coroner \u2019s verdict found to have died because of the vaccine . The impatience and frustration of those so affected is now palpable . Having lost their loved ones more than a year ago , some have been badgering the Under - Secretary of State for Health and Social Care , my Hon Friend the Member for Lewes [ Maria Caulfield ] , for action \u2014 I am pleased to see her on the Front Bench . I understand that yesterday she blocked vaccine victims on her Twitter account and today she closed her Twitter account completely . This is an indication of the strength of feeling among the public . \u201d \" \" Those who were in perfect health before their vaccine have encountered too much ignorance and scepticism when seeking medical help . For some , their general practitioner has refused to engage , to the extent that they are made to feel gaslighted , with their physical pain being dismissed or explained away as mental illness . How insulting and humiliating is that and how at odds with the principles of the national health service ? \u201d The \" \" Coronavirus vaccine - weekly summary of the Yellow Card Reporting \u201d ( https :// www . gov . uk / government / publications / coronavirus - covid - 19 - vaccine - adverse - reactions / coronavirus - vaccine - summary - of - yellow - card - reporting ) which I trust you are familiar with provides details of yellow card reports - each week more adverse events and deaths are reported . Through an organisation , UK Citizen , I am aware of two hundred and fifty ( 250 ) formal Covid - 19 vaccine injury statements been made and subsequently lodged with the police . In addition there were many more people who came forward to share their experience of vaccine injury and bereavement , but who were not comfortable filing a formal witness statement . The gaslighting of the Covid - 19 \u201c vaccine \u201d injured and bereaved must stop . The public should have been told , at the outset , that the Covid - 19 \u201c vaccines \u201d were ( and are ) experimental and remain in clinical trial . This did not happen , \u201c informed consent \" \" was consequently not possible - the Government failed the public . Subsequently , the Government used coercive methods to get the public to take the Covid - 19 \u201c vaccines \u201d in contravention of the principles of public service as enshrined in the Nolan Principles . Now the Government is failing to recognise that there are adverse effects from the \u201c vaccines \u201d - this is simply unconscionable . The Government must make the public aware of the risks involved in taking the Covid - 19 \u201c vaccines \u201d ; be transparent about injuries and deaths ; and provide care and compensation for those injured or bereaved . Clause 1(2)(a ) of the Bill provides that the review must consider the effectiveness of MHRA in the monitoring of side effects and the NHS and Government response to such monitoring - it is evident from everything stated above that such a review is vital .

Ukraine is the new shiny toy . Put down their bread . Take your eyes off their circuses . Pay attention . In the bought - off halls of Congress right now , Senate and House collaborators are preparing to send legislation to President Joe Biden that will open the floodgates to more foreign tech workers , wealthy foreign investors and foreign students \u2014 while our own homegrown American tech workforce , American business owners and American STEM graduates are still reeling from pandemic disruptions and displacements . The Senate passed the $ 250 billion U.S. Innovation and Competition Act last June . The House passed a similar measure , the $ 350 billion America Competes Act , last month . Biden wielded his State of the Union address to push for reconciliation of the two bills so he can commence another massive giveaway to foreign and domestic special interests . The just - approved House bill would create a new visa category on top of the dozens of alphabet - soup visas already in existence . According to the open - borders , big business - backed American Action Forum , the \u201c W \u201d visa program will benefit three groups of foreign nationals : \u201c W - 1 , entrepreneurs with ownership interest in a start - up ; W - 2 , essential employees of a start - up ; and W - 3 , W - 1 and W - 2 holders \u2019 spouses and children . \u201d Based on dubious \u201c job creation \u201d criteria similar to the fraud - riddled EB - 5 investor visa program , if the foreigners \u2019 startups are \u201c successful , \u201d the W visa holders could soon join the already overwhelming annual tide of 1 million green card winners who take up jobs in the U.S. and are then eligible for citizenship . Only in the Swamp can a bill handing out citizenship for sale to the highest bidders be marketed as a way to help America \u201c compete . \u201d \u2026 Then there \u2019s the poison pill for Americans studying in science , technology , engineering or mathematics ( STEM ) . The House bill would lift the cap on immigrant visas for foreign nationals and their entire immediate families if they have doctoral degrees in STEM fields . Silicon Valley lobbyists will claim ( as they have disingenuously argued for the past three decades ) that there is a catastrophic shortage of high - skilled , high - tech labor . Other provisions of the House bill would grant amnesty and work permits to illegal aliens and refugees from Hong Kong , and \u201c special immigrant visas \u201d to 5,000 \u201c high - skilled \u201d Hong Kong residents for up to five fiscal years for a total of 25,000 new green card holders flooding the American tech workforce . Only in the Swamp can legislation that busts open the cheap foreign labor pipeline and undermines native American STEM graduates be sold as a vehicle for increasing American competitiveness . And that \u2019s just the tip of the iceberg . Buried in the America Competes Act is a side bill snuck in as a last - minute amendment called the College Transparency Act , which will radically expand the federal government \u2019s ability to conduct surveillance , tracking and profiling , of every college student in this country . According to The Federalist , the bill opens the door to collection of \u201c student - related surveys , race or ethnicity , age , sex , attendance , program of study , military or veteran benefit status , enrollment and credential status , distance education enrollment status , and federal Pell Grant status . \u201d In addition , \u201c economic status , participation in remedial coursework , status as a parent of dependent children , incarceration or confinement status , disability status , and \u2018 other \u2019 undefined data \u201d will be collected \u201c as the government later deems necessary . \u201d There would be no means to opt out of this national student database , and the bill \u201c specifically allows third parties to sell student data . \u201d ", "input": "", "output": "CONSPIRACY"}, {"instruction": "Labeling a text as conspiratorial when it is, in fact, merely oppositional to mainstream views, could potentially lead those who were simply asking questions closer to conspiracy communities.

We are in a situation right now where multiple organisations and individuals in government , the civil service and many public institutions are committing these crimes by continuing to administer and allowing the administering of these vaccines with the express knowledge they are causing significant harm , injury and death . \u201c I \u2019m only doing my job . \u201d \u201c I \u2019m only following orders . \u201d \u201c The government says its lawful so it continues \u201d \u201c They are safe and effective \u2019 \u201d These retorts are no longer acceptable and as such , having knowledge of harm and injury and continuing to administer the vaccines renders almost every single person involved complicit and guilty of these serious crimes . I have previously spoken to Dr Malhotra about making a criminal complaint to the Police . I have also made my views very clear regarding all police forces , they must set up major incident rooms , fully staffed with the right blend of professionals to obtain complaint statements from the many thousands of victims injured , or those who have suffered the loss of a loved one as a result of these experimental so called vaccines . What is even more alarming is the vaccines were never tested for preventing transmission , confirmed in a recent hearing by the head of Pfizer in the European Parliament . Taking the vaccine to protect Grandma and others is now proven to be the lie of the millennia and this is by their own admission . The MHRA have a lot to answer for as do Sage and Messrs Whitty , Vallance , Van Tam , Johnson , Zahawi and Hancock . There is evidence of direct communication via email exchange that some of the above knew about the dangers of the vaccines as far back as June 2021 but ignored the credible warnings . We are at a stage right now , today , where we have a duty to stop this harm and death and bring an end to this disgusting agenda that is NOT to protect Grandma or the NHS but something much more sinister . As members of Parliament , an eminent doctor , an expert from within the vaccine industry and a retired Police Constable we swore an oath to protect the public and to do no harm . There also needs to be more Ministers prepared to step forward and voice their concerns and join us en masse and take this directly to the police . There are many doctors and nurses who are ready to speak out , world renowned experts who are silenced by social media and news agencies , professors , virologists , immunologists , funeral directors , Dr Mike Yeadon himself a former VP at Pfizer for seventeen years who I know has already addressed his concerns in writing to Parliament back in 2020 , Dr Robert Malone inventor of the MRNA technology all standing up and shouting from the roof tops to stop this . The MHRA , IOPC , HMIC , UKHSA , NICE , Police Federation of England and Wales , Metropolitan Police Federation , Sadiq Khan \u2019s office , association of police and crime commissioners , Baroness Hallett chair of the independent public inquiry committee into COVID , lead barrister Hugo Keith and senior police across the U.K. have all been made aware by me and the replies from them all is .... \u201c If you are reporting crimes contact the police . \u201d We go to the police and they say . \u201c It \u2019s lawful , you need to speak to your MP . \u201d We can not continue going around in circles , as MP \u2019s you need to come together as a collective and with all of the aforementioned experts make criminal complaints to the police and they have to act .

Martha was an exceptionally healthy and vibrant 37 - year - old young mother with no underlying health conditions ... Martha 's greatest passion was to be the best mother possible for Jeannine and Mary . Nothing would stand in her way to be present in their lives . During the last weeks of her life , however , the world turned dark with heavy - handed vaccine mandates . Local and state governments were determined to strip away her right to consult her wisdom and enjoy her freedom . She had been vehemently opposed to taking the vaccine , knowing she was in good health and of a young age and thus not at risk for serious illness . In her mind , the known and unknown risks of the unproven vaccine were more of a threat . But , slowly , day by day , her freedom to choose was stripped away .

I entirely agree : they are vulnerable to breathtaking levels of dangerous misinformation generated by the very institutions they are supposed to trust . May I turn your attention to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists ( RCOS ) here in the UK . This august institution has been around for nearly a century and is an esteemed national authority , advising government on health policy and issuing advice to healthcare professionals and the public on reproductive health in women and girls . They have a guide for pregnant women and those trying to get pregnant on whether to get the Covid - 19 vaccination \u2013 issued in partnership with the Royal College of Midwives , the UK Teratology Information Service and the MacDonald Obstetric Medicine Society . In my view , all four of these supposed pillars of public health are publishing misleading advice that could have catastrophic consequences for women and their babies . You can view their guide here . In a nutshell it tells women that Covid - 19 vaccines are \u2018 safe and effective \u2019 at every stage of pregnancy , including if you are trying for a baby . Where to begin with this nonsense ? Let \u2019s start with two obvious points . There is NO evidence that the Covid genetic vaccines are safe in pregnancy for mother or baby . None . What we do have is mounting evidence that these genetic vaccines are anything but safe or effective . These injections are experimental . We should never , NEVER use experimental drugs during pregnancy . Never . I could go on \u2013 there is just so much wrong here . Women and girls deserve better . Please tell everyone you know \u2013 but especially women \u2013 to stay away from these institutions for their own safety . I also invite you \u2013 no , I urge you to watch this excellent presentation by World Council for Health Steering Committee member Christof Plothe . He has done what the RCOG failed to do , and spent countless hours and days analysing the trial data to understand what impact the Covid - 19 injections are having on fertility , women \u2019s health in general , and pregnancy . Christof is a true scientist : rigorous , balanced and deeply humane . His findings are alarming but they are important to the misinformation and \u2013 let \u2019s face it , lies \u2013 peddled by the RCOG and its partners in crime . Please share .

If she is also experiencing tremors , then she 's unfortunately contracted something else on top of that . I do n't doubt that the vaccine caused that as well , as they 've been proven to be dangerous by countless peer - reviewed studies and respected medical doctors . I 'm in total agreement with you there . 2 . Like I said earlier , this one person faking it does n't delegitimize real cases . I do n't doubt that you 've seen other videos and while I 'm not able to assess their validity without having analyzed them personally , there 's a good chance that at least some of them are real . What I 'm suggesting is that you share the real ones around rather than this one which was clearly faked , because this one will only serve to elicit mockery towards us and our cause . Spreading fake videos is n't helping anyone except the one who 's profiting from the GoFundMe and the globalists who thrive on disinformation and turmoil . 3 . What the world needs right now is for people to join together to fight against the globalists , and you attacking people on your own side is actively counterproductive . I 've shown you objective evidence that she 's faking it for money and clout and profiting on your behalf , and yet you continue to attack me for merely speaking the truth . We need to be the side that spreads truth and calls out fake news and misinformation . Think for yourself and do n't let them deceive you like this . 4 .

Using an experimental vaccine , which included a protein crucial to successfully bringing a baby to term , the outcomes of these efforts told the perpetrators that this method , inducing a state of auto - immunity to ones own pregnancy , could certainly work . Now , I \u2019m not suggesting that this is the intention of the so - called \u201c vaccines \u201d vs Covid19 . But to dismiss the point , pretending that it \u2019s NOT POSSIBLE to bring about infertility using interventions described as vaccines , is extremely concerning . I was among the first to raise a red flag on the potential use of c19 vaccines in pregnancy . I raised a flag for two main categories of reasons . 1 . We knew that younger women , those of childbearing potential , were not at a markedly elevated risk of bad outcomes & death if infected by the alleged pandemic virus . The gains from intervening medically are so slight that they \u2019re easily outweighed by the risks associated with such medical interventions . Yet I could see & hear authority figures , such as people from the Royal Colleges of Obstetrics & Gynaecology , outright lying women . They were told the vaccines were absolutely safe in pregnancy and also required . 2 . In practice , full reproductive toxicity tests were not performed . Limited studies had troubling observations . Theoretical concerns were identified & far from being removed by human studies , these concerns were amplified . But the authorities just lied about them . I have no doubt that , at minimum , they did not care if pregnancies were harmed . Their massed use was reckless & is continuing .

Dr. Bhakdi likens the mRNA \u201c vaccines \u201d to \u201c letters in envelopes \u201d and emphasizes that they are dangerous and poisonous in several ways : 1 . The \u201c letters \u201d ( mRNAs ) travel to unknown destinations in the body , taken up by cells that the virus would never have reached . These cells are in the lymph nodes and the vascular endothelia , and the damage to the cells that receive and execute the messages in these letters will cause grave harm , including blood clots and damage to the immune system itself . 2 . The \u201c envelope \u201d \u2013 the lipid nanoparticles \u2013 is pure poison , because it contains toxic cationic ( positively charged ) lipids . Natural lipids either have no charge or are negatively charged . Most of the important molecules in our cells are negatively charged , and the cationic lipids bind to them and interfere with their function .

All UCHealth employees not vaccinated by October 1st , will be terminated , and their termination will be marked \u2018 voluntary . \u2019 Some were able to get religious exemptions , which will make them second class citizens at UCHealth locations subject to different rules . I spoke with a woman today who said that she is banned from working at the Colorado Springs Memorial location because she has n\u2019t been jabbed . Employees able to get the religious exemption reported that they will be expected to get PCR tested every 72 hours or face termination . This is a major move that will impact a great deal of people and so far I have read 1 article that barely mentions UCHealth . Why the media is n\u2019t covering this is a mystery to me . Also keep in mind , jabbed or not , the hospital can only hold as many patients as they have staff to service . This will rapidly cause an extreme strain on an already short - handed industry . We keep hearing in the media that our hospitals are being flooded with patients , when in reality , they are only full in regard to what their staffing can bear . They are short - handed and it \u2019s about to get worse . Of course what we will hear in the media is that the pandemic has reached such proportions that the hospitals can not keep up , when the reality is that they just terminated a huge portion of their staff . This is a new manufactured shortage in the health care industry that UCHealth leadership has chosen to enact . They have chosen this path and our communities will suffer the consequences . Again , the media seems to be silent on this so please share this story , reach out to those you know in this industry to let them know that we , as a community , support them !

In the last week of January 2022 , WHO held an emergency meeting and consultations in Geneva on the extension of its powers to take over all member States in the event of a pandemic and \" any other form of threat or disaster \" . WHO wants member States to sign a new Covid - 19 treaty extending the 2005 treaty . Once signed by the ministers of health , the Constitution of the WHO ( according to its article 9 ) takes precedence over the constitution of a country in the event of a natural disaster or pandemic ( 189 countries have signed the 2005 treaty ) . Since the definition of a pandemic was changed a few years ago ( cases based on the PCR test ) , they can impose obedience in any country and impose on the population the WHO guidelines , which are mandatory , not only recommended . And that sounds like power over the country and the world . Dr Astrid Stuckelberger , who has worked for WHO for 20 years , warns that all countries should send a public letter of protest to WHO . \" Governments \" should write a letter stating that people do not accept that the signing of the Health Minister can decide the fate of millions of people without a referendum . It is very important to send this letter from each country to the WHO in Geneva . WHO wants all countries to implement the measures by May 2022 .

He is one of many challenging the WHO \u2019s proposed pandemic agreement which , if confirmed in 2024 at the 77th World Health Assembly as planned , would undermine people \u2019s sovereign rights in every member nation . You can read more about it here , but in brief , the proposals would give the WHO legal authority to declare a pandemic and then impose public health measures across all member nations . Think lockdowns , mask mandates and enforced medical interventions . Governments would no longer have the right to set their own policies , so member states would be at the mercy of one , unelected , corrupt \u2018 health \u2019 organisation , currently headed up by a man with no medical background who recently overruled the WHO \u2019s emergency committee to unilaterally declare monkeypox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern ( PHEIC ) . How could the WHO possibly pull off such an outrageous power grab , you may well ask ? By being smart , and not a little sneaky . This is what Sabelo warned us about back in May . He explained that the WHO was working toward its pandemic agreement by ensuring the amendments were implemented country by country . This is precisely what is happening . Right now , all eyes need to be on South Africa , as this wonderful country \u2013 my birth country \u2013 is facing a nightmare situation that concerns all of us , everywhere . Its government is considering a shocking set of amendments to its health legislation that would remove people \u2019s rights to bodily autonomy . These amendments include forcing people into quarantine \u2013 which for most people will require them to go to state - run facilities ( ie . concentration camps ) \u2013 forcing people to undergo medical examination , and to accept medical treatment against their will . Please watch Sabelo explain the full implications here . His video currently has under 7,000 views , we need to bump that up several times over so please share widely . If South Africa accepts these amendments , it will be fully aligned with the WHO \u2019s proposed pandemic agreement . Remember Sibelo \u2019s warning : if the WHO has its way , amendments like these may be coming to your country , too . Tell a friend !

The US military is no longer playing these games . In the period from January to February 2021 , the CPC allegedly had troops on the Canadian and Mexican border that were supposed to move to America after Biden took office , numbering from 250,000 to 300,000 troops .

The Alliance fulfilled its threat to the Deep State to \" destroy them \" when the CCP troops passed through underground tunnels into New York State , and as we think to Pennsylvania , from the intelligence received . The first 25,000 Chinese soldiers were destroyed in an underground DUMB ( Deep Underground Military Base ) by an F - 16 bomber that dropped a bomb to destroy bunkers . The F - 16 was hit by counterstrikes and after release flew over Michigan , where the pilot ejected to safety somewhere in upper Michigan . DUMB , which housed 50,000 soldiers , was a deeper tunnel , and the Alliance military used \" God Rods \" launched from a satellite , representing \" shells in the form of tungsten steel telephone poles \" that can penetrate to a depth of up to ten kilometers without using any explosive devices , the impact is enough to destroy at great depth .

In England , compulsory vaccination against smallpox was first introduced in 1852 , yet in the period 1857 to 1859 , a smallpox epidemic killed 14,244 people . In 1863 to 1865 , a second epidemic claimed 20,059 lives . In 1867 , a more stringent compulsory vaccination law was passed and those who evaded vaccination were prosecuted . After an intensive tour year effort to vaccinate the entire population between the ages of 2 - 50 , the Chief Medical Officer of England announced in May 1871 that 97.5 % had been vaccinated . In the following year , 1872 , England experienced its worst ever smallpox epidemic which claimed 44,840 lives . Between 1871 - 1880 , during the period of compulsory vaccination , the death rate from smallpox leapt from 28 to 46 per 100,000 population . Writing in the British Medical Journal ( 21/1/1928 p116 ) Dr L Parry questions the vaccination statistics which revealed a higher death rate amongst the vaccinated than the unvaccinated and asks : \" \" How is it that smallpox is five times as likely to be fatal in the vaccinated as in the unvaccinated ? \" \" How is it that in some of our best vaccinated towns - for example , Bombay and Calcutta - smallpox is rife , whilst in some of our worst vaccinated towns , such as Leicester , it is almost unknown ? \" \" How is it that something like 80 per cent of the cases admitted Into the Metropolitan Asylums Board smallpox hospitals have been vaccinated , whilst only 20 per cent have not been vaccinated ? \" \" How is it that in Germany , the best vaccinated country in the world , there are more deaths in proportion to the population than In England - for example , in 1919 , 28 deaths in England , 707 In Germany ; In 1920 , 30 deaths In England , 354 In Germany In Germany In 1919 There were 5,012 cases of smallpox with 707 deaths ; in England In 1925 There were 5,363 cases of smallpox with 6 deaths . What is the explanation ? In Scotland , between 1855 - 1875 , over 9,000 children under 5 died of smallpox despite Scotland being , at that time , one of the most vaccinated countries in the world . In 1907 - 1919 with only a third of the children vaccinated , only 7 smallpox deaths were recorded for children under 5 years of age . In Germany , in the years 1870 - 1 871 , over 1,000,000 people had smallpox of which 120,000 died . 96 % of these had been vaccinated . An address sent to the governments of the various German states from Bismarck , the Chancellor of Germany , contained the following comments : \" \" ... the hopes placed in the efficacy of the cowpox virus as preventative of smallpox have proved entirely deceptive \" \" . In the Philippines , prior to US takeover in 1905 , case mortality from smallpox was about 10 % . In 1905 , following the commencement of systematic vaccination enforced by the US Government , an epidemic occurred where the case mortality ranged from 25 % to 50 % in different parts of the islands . In 1918 - 1919 with over 95 % of the population vaccinated , the worst epidemic in the Philippine 's history occurred resulting in a case mortality of 65 % . The highest percentage occurred in the capital Manila , the most thoroughly vaccinated place . The lowest percentage occurred in Mindanao , the least vaccinated place owing to religious prejudices . Dr V de Jesus , Director of Health , stated that the 1918 - 1919 smallpox epidemic resulted in 60,855 deaths . The 1920 Report of the Philippines Health Service contains the following comments : \" \" From the time in which smallpox was practically eradicated In the city of Manila to the year 1918 ( about 9 years ) in which the epidemic appears certainly In one of its severest forms , hundreds after hundreds of thousands of people were yearly vaccinated with the most unfortunate result that the 1918 epidemic looks prima facie as a flagrant failure of the classic Immunization towards future epidemics \" \" . In Japan , 1885 , 13 years after compulsory vaccination commenced in 1872 , a law was passed requiring re - vaccination every seven years . From 1886 to 1892 , 25,474,370 revaccinations were record \" ", "input": "", "output": "CRITICAL"}, {"instruction": "Labeling a text as conspiratorial when it is, in fact, merely oppositional to mainstream views, could potentially lead those who were simply asking questions closer to conspiracy communities.

On March 10 , 2022 , the CDC sent this astonishing response to both of these requests : NCHS [ National Center for Health Statistics ] has not conducted the analyses requested for this age group and therefore can not provide you with a data product . So , despite not having conducted the \u201c analyses \u201d of its own data for either of these age groups and , therefore , not being able to cite even one confirmed case of a healthy child 15 years old or younger dying from COVID - 19 , the CDC felt confident enough not only to relentlessly promote COVID - 19 vaccines to these children , but it also makes the truly incredible claim that \u201c COVID - 19 ranks as one of the top 10 causes of death for children ages 5 though 11 years . \u201d This , despite the fact that , when pressed for proof of that statement , the CDC admits it has n\u2019t analyzed its own data and can not provide any .

STORY AT - A - GLANCE Dr. Robert Malone says he was kicked off twitter for this 40 - minute video presentation and PDF created by the Canadian Covid Care Alliance , which consists of over 500 independent doctors , scientists , and health care practitioners . The video and PDF are a deep - dive into Pfizer \u2019s own vaccine trial data which conclusively shows an INCREASED risk of illness and death for the vaccinated . For example , there were 20 total deaths in the vaccinated group versus 14 total deaths in the placebo group with nearly double the amount of cardiovascular deaths among the vaccinated . Furthermore , Pfizer unblinded the trial participants , tested the Covid - 19 vaccine on healthy and young individuals rather than the sick and elderly and did not track any subclinical biomarkers which would be valuable early warning signs of disease caused by the vaccines . Pfizer reported a 95 % efficacy , which sounds like it protects you 95 % of the time , but that 95 % actually refers to the Relative Risk Reduction , while the Absolute Risk Reduction was only 0 . 84 % . Moreover , the Pfizer clinical results are unreliable because Pfizer introduced immense subjectivity into the trial by leaving it up to the discretion of investigators whether or not to test participants for covid - 19 . There were a total of 3,410 participants who had Covid - 19 symptoms but were not tested for Covid - 19 . Pfizer reported one of their 12 - year - old trial participants who has been paralyzed to a wheelchair and forced to eat from a feeding tube for the last 10 - months as \u201c functional abdominal pain \u201d . Another whistleblower who was a regional director of Pfizer \u2019s clinical trials also reported to the FDA that Pfizer had falsified data , unblinded participants , and not followed up on testing participants who reported symptoms , but neither the FDA nor Pfizer ever investigated the issue . Pfizer \u2019s report authors had conflicts of interest with 84 % of them either employed by Pfizer , owning Pfizer stock , receiving grants from Pfizer , hired as consultants by Pfizer , or previously running clinical trials for Pfizer . For example , two of the Pfizer report authors actually made $ 9B in stock market profit directly from the Pfizer vaccines because they also happened to be the co - founders of BioNTech . https :// kanekoa . substack . com / p / the - powerful - pfizer - presentation @ ericmartinez ", "input": "", "output": "CRITICAL"}, {"instruction": "Labeling a text as conspiratorial when it is, in fact, merely oppositional to mainstream views, could potentially lead those who were simply asking questions closer to conspiracy communities.

This program aims at developing a long - acting injectable Ivermectin formulation for several months to protect people who are not infected with Covid - 19 in order to break the virus chain of transmission . Such a tool could play a decisive role in the management of Covid - 19 pandemic , by enabling many people around the world , especially those most exposed and at risk , to protect themselves . \" \" This is a third way between a treatment and a vaccine , \" \" explains Christophe Douat , CEO of MedinCell . \u201c To date , no vaccine has ever been developed for a Coronavirus , and a virus can mutate , making the vaccine ineffective .

Whereas before Thanos saw himself as a cosmic force of balance in his cold , emotionless posture here in this scene we see a rejection of the natural order and a rebellious assertion to self - will and power to control destiny and reform it in his own image \u2014 this is Luciferianism at it \u2019s core . It \u2019s Satanic towards the masses ( extinction ) but Promethean - Luciferian towards his own being ( assertion of self - will ) . What unites Thanos and Morgoth / Sauron is technocracy \u2014 rule by technological control . Both deploy advanced technology which seek to \u201c encircle \u201d or \u201c en - ring \u201d reality in their control ( what Heidgger called \u201c enframing \u201d ) . Note the strange overlap between stones and rings , both amulets of dark magic / technology placed within the hand ( symbol of extended power ) . Both Sauron / Morgoth and Thanos seek to enslave the masses ( Satanic ) while , for themselves , transcending the \u201c rules of the game . \u201d Each of these villains seeks to usurp a godlike or creator - like status ( Luciferian ) . The Luciferian and the Satanic both ultimately end up in the same place , though by different means . The destination or ultimate goal of both is the abolition of human reality . The Satanic energy seeks to reach that goal by the desecration and devolution of humanity to servile status . The Luciferian seeks to reach an abolition of humanity by transcending humanity into a trans - humanist future . Technocracy affords the perfect foil for an elite set on those twin goals \u2014 Luciferian for themselves as they \u201c transcend \u201d to a post - human techno - future and Satanic for the masses as they seek to enslave them into a sub - human expression . As Heidegger said technology enframes or encircles . Technology also \u201c de - worlds \u201d according to Heidegger . The environment will be one of , if not the , key mechanisms by which technocracy has been sold and will be sold . The environment in the form of ecological destruction or \u2014 as we see recently via viruses & pandemics \u2014 will be used as the tip of the technocratic spear . Technology run amuck , particularly in service to scientism , is what has created ecological destruction . Technology \u2014 as in technocracy \u2014 is what is pitching itself as the salvation to the damnation it has created . Not unlike a certain Devilish energy that is the source of damnation yet seeking to promote itself as the true path of redemption . \u2014 * Other films that point along this line would be Gattaca , Elysium , and Blade Runner 2049 . * * This narrative is different than the Infinity War Saga in the original Marvel comics whereby Thanos was in love with Hela ( Lady Death ) and sought to offer her the greatest gift of mass annihilation to prove his love .

An opinion titled Evidence - based medicine has been corrupted by corporate interests , failed regulation , and commercialisation of academia was published in the British Medical Journal and perfectly describes the current scientific dilemma we are currently observing . The authors correctly state that \" the advent of evidence - based medicine was a paradigm shift intended to provide a solid scientific foundation for medicine . The validity of this new paradigm , however , depends on reliable data from clinical trials , most of which are conducted by the pharmaceutical industry and reported in the names of senior academics . The release into the public domain of previously confidential pharmaceutical industry documents has given the medical community valuable insight into the degree to which industry - sponsored clinical trials are misrepresented . Until this problem is corrected , evidence - based medicine will remain an illusion . \" However , the most crucial section of the publication is the following , as it deals with the cause of the problems science is facing . \" Ironically , industry - sponsored key opinion leaders appear to enjoy many of the advantages of academic freedom , supported as they are by their universities , the industry , and journal editors for expressing their views , even when those views are incongruent with the real evidence . While universities fail to correct misrepresentations of the science from such collaborations , critics of industry face rejections from journals , legal threats , and the potential destruction of their careers . \" I have witnessed this phenomenon for myself . I lost my job at the University for pointing out scientific fraud that key players such as Christian Drosten and Marion Koopmans committed . Critical papers that we submitted were hardly accepted , and , if so , processed very slowly . All my former university colleagues are disciples of the public narrative . Some of them even called me a science denier . Academia has never been objective ; however , the current trend is disturbing . Academic freedom is a core principle critical for the conduct of science and its progress . Unfortunately , it deteriorated into a dogmatic religion in which those who question the narrative are treated as heretics . Every scientist should be allowed to question everything about Covid ( i.e. measures , official data , vaccine efficacy , etc . ) , climate change , etc . The fact that the UN and powerful NGOs are currently determining the science course needs to be reversed immediately .

His Sergeant at Arms releases all 14,000 hours of January 6 , 2021 tape to get the real story out and all communications at the Capitol and does criminal referrals on ANTIFA and BLM members who have yet to be arrested , and reconsider all peaceful / nonviolent attendees . 4 .

Inflammatory cytokines can be divided into two groups : those involved in acute inflammation and those responsible . Inflammation , the response of tissue to injury , is characterized in the acute phase by increased blood flow and vascular permeability along with the accumulation of fluid , leukocytes , and inflammatory mediators such as cytokines . Several cytokines play key roles in mediating acute inflammatory reactions , namely IL - 1 , TNF - a , IL - 6 , IL - 11 , IL - 8 and other chemokines , G - CSF , and GM - CSF . The cytokines known to mediate chronic inflammatory processes can be divided into those participating in humoral * inflammation * * , such as IL - 3 , IL - 4 , IL - 5 , IL - 6 , IL - 7 , IL - 9 , IL - 10 , IL - 13 , and transforming growth factor - b ( TGF - b ) , and those contributing to cellular inflammation such as IL - 1 , IL - 2 , IL - 3 , IL - 4 , IL - 7 , IL - 9 , IL - 10 , IL - 12 , interferons ( IFNs ) , IFN - g inducing factor ( IGIF ) , TGF - b , and TNF - a and - b.

So , what the hell happened ? There is a big flaw in the logic of evidence - based medicine as the basis for the practice of medicine as we know it , a practice based on science ; one that determines care down to the level of the individual patient . This flaw is nestled in the heart and soul of evidence - based medicine , which ( as we have seen over the last two years ) is not free of politics . It is naive to think that data and the process of licensure of new drugs is free from bias and conflicts of interest . In fact , this could n\u2019t be any farther from the truth . The COVID - 19 crisis of 2020 to 2022 has exposed for all to see how evidence based medicine has been corrupted by the governments , hospitalists , academia , big pharma , tech and social media . They have leveraged the processes and rationale of evidence - based medicine to corrupt the entire medical enterprise . Evidence based medicine depends on data . For the most part , the data gathering and analysis process is conducted by and for the pharmaceutical industry , then reported by senior academics . The problem , as laid out in an editorial in the British Medical Journal is as follows : The release into the public domain of previously confidential pharmaceutical industry documents has given the medical community valuable insight into the degree to which industry sponsored clinical trials are misrepresented . Until this problem is corrected , evidence based medicine will remain an illusion . This ideal of the integrity of data and the scientific process is corrupted as long as financial ( and governments ) interests trump the common good . Medicine is largely dominated by a small number of very large pharmaceutical companies that compete for market share , but are effectively united in their efforts to expanding that market . The short term stimulus to biomedical research because of privatization has been celebrated by free market champions , but the unintended , long term consequences for medicine have been severe . Scientific progress is thwarted by the ownership of data and knowledge because industry suppresses negative trial results , fails to report adverse events , and does not share raw data with the academic research community . Patients die because of the adverse impact of commercial interests on the research agenda , universities , and regulators . The pharmaceutical industry \u2019s responsibility to its shareholders means that priority must be given to their hierarchical power structures , product loyalty , and public relations propaganda over scientific integrity . Although universities have always been elite institutions prone to influence through endowments , they have long laid claim to being guardians of truth and the moral conscience of society . But in the face of inadequate government funding , they have adopted a neo - liberal market approach , actively seeking pharmaceutical funding on commercial terms . As a result , university departments become instruments of industry : through company control of the research agenda and ghostwriting of medical journal articles and continuing medical education , academics become agents for the promotion of commercial products . When scandals involving industry - academe partnership are exposed in the mainstream media , trust in academic institutions is weakened and the vision of an open society is betrayed ( BMJ ) .

They are NOT communists . Anyone who voted in 2020 for the Democratic ticket is a communist . They voted for policies consistent with socialism . They actually want America to be last , not first .

RINO Republicans are the Republicans who publicly say they support President Trump but actually in secret oppose him . I bet a large number of them actually voted against him in 2020 under the cloak of voter secrecy . Plus the number of RINO Republicans is not large as they are only the Republicans who hold \u201c selective \u201d public offices or appointments and leadership positions in the local , state , and national Republican Party organization . RINO Republicans are democrats in disguise . RINO Republicans are communists . The citizens who voted for President Trump in 2020 are NOT RINO Republicans . The effort by the communists to take over our country is doomed to failure . REAL Patriots outnumber them by a 4 to 1 margin . The key is to get the communists out of positions of leadership where they seek to control REAL Patriots . We get them out of leadership positions by ending rigged elections . We end rigged elections by putting those who rig them , or cover them up , in jail or worse . They are traitors to We The People . We must \u201c drain the swamp \u201d of communists .

Is this part of a depopulation agenda or \u2018 just \u2019 a terrible mistake ? \u27a8 drtesslawrie . substack . com / p / the - vaccines - damage - fertility - is Given everything we know about the pandemic \u2013 that Covid is eminently treatable , the vaccines are neither safe nor effective , millions have been injured as a direct result \u2013 why is the vaccine roll - out being allowed to continue ? More to the point , why were vaccines even rolled out in the first place ? There are many theories , ranging from the sinister to the plain venal . One of these is that a global elite believes that the planet is overcrowded and has implemented the pandemic and associated vaccine roll - out as part of a depopulation agenda . It sounds the stuff of movies , and yet there is a precedent . As Dr Andrew Wakefield \u2019s poignant new documentary , Infertility : A Diabolical Agenda , explains , the World Health Organisation spent many years researching and developing vaccines that would render recipients infertile . This line of research came from concern that populations were increasing at an unsustainable rate \u2013 and as the documentary reveals , the WHO apparently saw fit to implement its infertility vaccines without the informed consent of the women and girls who received them . If you have n\u2019t already , please do watch the documentary and share with others so that we can start discussing these matters together and in the open . Many concerns have been raised over the impact of Covid - 19 vaccines on fertility . The original Pfizer biodistribution studies ( English translation here ) reveal that the lipid nanoparticle ( LNP ) used to encapsulate the mRNA does not remain at the injection site as stated , but travels to major organs including the spleen , liver , adrenal glands , the testes and the ovaries . What is the impact of having toxic LNP accumulate in the reproductive organs ? That \u2019s the problem with inadequately tested medical interventions : we have no idea . However , data regarding reproductive health and fertility continue to mount . Now , a new peer - reviewed study , accepted for publication in the journal Andrology , reveals the Covid - 19 vaccines are harming male fertility . Why is the WHO not investigating this ?

The UK government has admitted that once you have been double - vaccinated , you will never again be able to acquire full natural immunity to Covid variants - or possibly any other virus . So let 's watch the real \" pandemic begin now ! In its Week 42 \" COVID - 19 Vaccine Surveillance Report \" , the UK Department of Health admits on page 23 that \" N antibody levels appear to be lower in people who become infected after two doses of vaccination \" . It goes on to say that this drop in antibodies is essentially permanent . What does this mean ? We know that vaccines do not prevent infection or transmission of the virus ( indeed , the report elsewhere shows that vaccinated adults are now much more likely to be infected than unvaccinated ones ) . The British now find that the vaccine interferes with the body 's ability to make antibodies after infection not only against the spike protein but also against other parts of the virus . In particular , vaccinated people do not appear to form antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein , the envelope of the virus , which is a crucial part of the response in unvaccinated people . In the long term , the vaccinated are far more susceptible to any mutations in the spike protein , even if they have already been infected and cured once or more . The unvaccinated , on the other hand , will gain lasting , if not permanent , immunity to all strains of the alleged virus after being naturally infected with it even once .

Well that is by design that not all shots have the same toxic ingredients in them or some have more of the toxic ingredients than other batches . We have covered this many times on our channel , by not only posting the pharma companies like Pf*zer admitting on their sites or the FDA site that they do this , since the shots are still in trial phase . Reminder that all shots are still in trial and only approved for emergency use by the FDA . Not that FDA full approval means they are safe by any means , as all vax are intended to cause harm and none contain any live viral anything , as vaccines have always been used to cause injuries the pharma companies can then profit on , by creating meds that are supposed to cure ( more lies for profit ) . Germ theory hoax is how the pharma industry became huge and they continue to milk this to this day , while not only getting richer but also sickening healthy people from birth , sterilizing , depopulating masses of innocent people worldwide . Destroying lives with their poisons . If you are still seemingly healthy and alive after jabs , consider yourself lucky and stop pushing your luck , because if you keep putting anything into your body by pharma , the next shot or meds could affect your health and life for the worst , just like billions of people who were n't as lucky as you . The Creator / Nature , whatever you believe has created you , has made your body strong to survive , if you eat an organic natural diet . Protect your DNA and do n't let anyone alter it . Your intact and pure DNA is designed perfectly for you to survive and stay healthy . No man can create a better immune system for you than the Creator .

GcMAF & Nagalase Doctors Jeff Bradstreet and Nicholas Gonzalez apparently were on to the biochemistry of what was causing autism and many chronic diseases . Their research apparently had zeroed in on a specific set of proteins and enzymes that can cause the human immune system to malfunction . There are fears that these doctors may have been murdered . Apparently , the European company that manufactured GcMAF had been shut down in July 2015 . Also , another coincidence is that many of the dead doctors were visited by U.S. government agency officials in the weeks prior to their deaths . Nagalase becomes involved with creating cytokine storms after vaccinations , inflammation , and a host of other chronic diseases like Diabetes , Lupus , Lyme disease , Multiple Sclerosis \u2014 especially cancer and heart disease . Viewers ought to realize the importance of having a blood test for Vitamin D levels in order to offset not only cancer , but other chronic diseases , especially if one has had vaccinations , especially annual flu shots , in my opinion , since nagalase can be introduced into the body by viruses and injection .

Flu cases went from 38 million in 2019 to 1,822 in 2020 . This data should have been MASSIVE red flag to every doc / nurse that flu was being recategorized as Covid - 19 . Doctors who claim CV19 exists are either incompetent or deceitful , as NO scientist or health agency in the world can produce a sample of the isolated virus , which is an ESSENTIAL prerequisite to identifying any new organism / virus . The only \" evidence \" the CDC has of CV19 is a computer generated virus sequence that was built using genome software . We 're all being lied to . Covid symptoms purposely fall under a broad category of respiratory illnesses to deceive people into taking a fraudulent Covid test . The Covid PCR test CAN\u2019T DETECT VIRUSES . It says right on the box \u201c NOT TO BE USED FOR DIAGNOSTIC PURPOSES \u201d . The Covid test was designed to detect RNA that can be found in any human being as a way to drum - up phony cases to perpetuate the illusion of a pandemic . Although Ivermectin / HCQ can successfully treat certain respiratory illnesses , Covid - 19 is n't one of them because it does n't exist . Therefor , it \u2019s extremely disingenuous for any doctor to claim that they have a cure for CV19 . Crooked health agencies / hospitals around world use / used fraudulent PCR test & recategorized flu & endless other illnesses as CV19 to create illusion of a pandemic . In addition , Remdesivir was mandated as Covid treatment by Fauci , despite killing 53 % of participants in Ebola treatment study published in New England Journal of Medicine in 2019 . Death by Remdesivir is blamed on Covid as an additional way to perpetuate the illusion that a deadly virus exists . The UK 's weapon of choice is a drug called Medazolam - Ventilators also played major role in snuffing out people world wide . Fauci \u2019s Mandated Covid Treatments Incentivize Hospitals to Murder Patients : The CARES Act provides incentives for hospitals to use Covid - 19 treatment protocols dictated by the government based on NIH recommendations . Hospital payments / incentives include : - Bonus payment for each positive COVID - 19 diagnosis . - Bonus for COVID - 19 admission to hospital . - 20 % bonus payment from Medicare on the entire hospital bill for use of Remdesivir , a drug proven deadly in 2019 study . - Bonus payment to hospital if COVID - 19 patient is placed on a ventilator . - Additional payment received if cause of death is reported as COVID - 19 , even if patient did not die FROM COVID - 19 . - - In addition , COVID - 19 diagnosis provides extra payments to coroners .

This is from an unfortunately defunct Rutgers University article : As Professor Wayne Crans of Rutgers University so nicely puts it \" \" mosquitoes are not flying hypodermic needles . \" \" The \" \" snout \" \" of a mosquito , the part that looks like a needle , is actually composed of six mouthparts . Four of these are used to pierce the skin of the person or animal that the mosquito is biting . The other two parts are composed of two tubes . One of the tubes sends saliva into the host and the other sends blood up to the mosquito . This two tube system is one reason why mosquitoes are unable to transmit HIV . Only saliva is injected into humans when a mosquito bites and thus HIV positive blood that a mosquito may have previously ingested is never transmitted to other humans .

I think that no one ( of those who make decisions ) will pay attention , but I promised and , therefore , I keep my promise . So , let 's briefly assess the operational situation : 1 . On our part : after the \" successful completion of the first stage of the operation \" ( which ended in a large - scale RETREAT from the territory of the Kiev , Chernihiv and Sumy regions ) - there is a redeployment and concentration of forces in the Donetsk sector of the front . Apparently ( and according to the statements of the political leadership of the Russian Federation ) , it is here that it is planned to carry out the \" second stage \" and solve the problem of completely clearing the territory of the LDNR from enemy groups . Obviously , the calculation is being made on the creation of two or three strike groups sufficient in number , which - with the concentrated support of all aviation forces and most of the artillery - will \" grind \" the opposing Ukrainian forces ( which are still estimated for some reason not highly ) and defeat them in one big battle . 2 . On the part of the Armed Forces of Ukraine : the plans of the command of the RF Armed Forces are well known to the enemy , and he - the enemy - does not at all consider the defeat of his grouping inevitable . On the contrary , the Armed Forces of Ukraine intend to defend themselves on their heavily fortified positions , relying on previously and newly created ( the command of the RF Armed Forces provided them with enough time ) fortified nodes in the alleged directions of the strike of the Russian troops ( and they are obvious - it \u2019s enough to look at the map ) . We ask ourselves the question : does the superiority of the RF Armed Forces in aviation and heavy weapons guarantee victory over an enemy ( for whom offensive plans are obvious ) prepared for defense , with high morale ? My answer is NO , not guaranteed . Why ? - I answer : The \" superiority \" of the RF Armed Forces in aviation and artillery is very relative . Since the enemy has a well - equipped and numerous military air defense , which seriously limits the actions of tactical aviation , which is capable of supporting its troops on the battlefield . The enemy has an ADVANTAGE in the means of field and artillery reconnaissance ( unmanned aerial vehicles of various classes are already almost at the platoon level ) . And its artillery has good weapons and well - trained personnel . And against the numerous Russian armored vehicles - the Armed Forces of Ukraine ( in defense conditions ) are quite capable due to the really huge amount of anti - tank weapons in the hands of the infantry ( ATGM ) . In conditions when Russian troops will have to storm one urban agglomeration after another , the amount of manpower comes to the fore . But in it , the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and the Armed Forces of the LDNR , alas , do not have a serious advantage . Suppose , having overcome the first line of defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine south of Izyum and in the Gulyai - Pole area , our troops begin to advance in converging directions .

Did you know , for example , that the creative executive and producer for YouTube Originals is a veteran Obama - Biden operative , consultant on the Biden - Harris administration \u2019s vaccine education campaign , and close former aide of Michelle Obama ? YouTube Originals \u2019 staffer Lauren Vrazilek tweeted last week that she \u201c had a blast \u201d making the Harris video . She tagged four top Harris staffers in her tweet : VP communications director Ashley Etienne , VP digital strategist Brenna Parker , VP director of press operations Peter Velz and VP personal aide Opal Vadhan ... Vrazilek served as former first lady Michelle Obama \u2019s media consultant on her \u201c Becoming \u201d book tour in 2018 - 2019 . Prior to that , the YouTube Originals creative director and producer worked for the Obama White House for nearly six years as an intern , director of correspondence , associate director of digital engagement , and deputy press secretary to Mrs. Obama . When Biden - Harris took office in January , Vrazilek exulted on Twitter : \u201c Apparently when you do n\u2019t work in DC people expect you to work on Inauguration Day ? I had a bowl of ice cream and a cry before 8 am \u2014 the chances of me doing anything but gushing over President Biden and Madam Vice President Harris are slim to none . \u201d ... \u201c Slim to none \u201d are also the odds that parents can rely on YouTube to provide anything other than slanted brainwashing to their kids . Google / YouTube \u2019s parent company , Alphabet , forked over $ 21 million to Democrats in 2020 . The revolving door between Google and White House Democrats is notorious . In April 2016 , the Campaign for Accountability tracked 61 Google or Google - tied employees leaving the tech conglomerate to take federal government jobs and 171 Obama - Biden staffers jumping ship to work for Google . Even more insidiously , you must remember that GooTube has repeatedly violated children \u2019s privacy : \u2014 Google / YouTube admitted to data mining children \u2019s emails without consent and in violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act . \u2014 In 2019 , the Federal Trade Commission levied a $ 170 million fine against Google / YouTube over its violation of the federal Children \u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act . \u2014 Last September , Google / YouTube was slapped with a massive class - action lawsuit in the U.K. accusing \u201c the platform of routinely breaking U.K. and European data protection laws by unlawfully targeting up to five million under - 13 - year - olds with addictive programming and harvesting their data for advertisers . \u201d Lawyers for families lambasted the Silicon Valley giant in their announcement , claiming execs and employees \u201c know full well that millions of children watch YouTube . They \u2019re making money from unlawfully harvesting data about these young children as they watch YouTube videos \u2014 and then running highly targeted adverts , designed to influence vulnerable young minds . \u201d Truly curious journalists in the Beltway might want to know more about how many more Lauren Vrazileks are planted at Google / YouTube and working intimately with Biden / Harris to pump out political programming for young online addicts whose data is being mined , monetized and weaponized by the manufactured - reality managers of Big Tech .

Within weeks we \u2019ll have this horrific push . In Austria , the Covid Antigen tests are required every 2 days to any that / don\u2019t want do n\u2019t have vaccine \u2013 in Netherlands , UK , Australia , all over the world . And the government is not paying for it . These people are against the forced coercion . They are against the subterfuge . Pfizer signed with the US Government , a 55 year waiver to all liability from the vaccine . In \u201c Occupied Europe \u201d the pressure is intense . It \u2019s impossible to fathom how we can move from normalcy to insanity so quickly but here it is . It \u2019s coming to US in a matter of weeks . In the meantime , the brilliant , courageous Mike Lindell , together with many heroes , has pushed the 2020 ELECTION STEAL lawsuits to the Supreme Court and tomorrow , November 23rd , we have Our Day in Court . If the Supreme Court is cleared of corrupt influences , then the verdict will be clearly stated , DECERTIFY THE ELECTION . The Military will be called to act . This is a pivotal week in history . This is our absolute back wall . This is what we \u2019ve been waiting for ! This is our Week of Reckoning . The importance of this week and the subsequent actions demonstrated , tell us all where we stand and what to expect . 1 ) If the 2020 Election is DECERTIFIED , then everything is undone \u2013 everything Biden has done is stopped and corrections will immediately follow . The Crimes Against the People \u2013 ala Nuremberg , ENDS and the criminals behind this murderous forced act will be held accountable . 2 ) If the Supreme Court does not act For the People , and on behalf of / according to the US Constitution , then we know , we \u2019re in for a battle . Things will get much worse . In Europe the people are required to carry passes to allow dining in restaurants , to allow shopping in grocery stores , visiting malls . People are being stopped in the street to check their vaccine passport . GOOGLE is taking over every app on \u201c Smart Phones \u201d cataloging / registering / reporting everything . This is tracking every movement , every conversation , text , comment \u2013 looking for what ? Coercion , forced action , absolute adherence to these Draconian measures , is standard operating procedure . The German Health Minister said , \u201c By the end of this winter all Germans will either be vaccinated , cured or dead . \u201d The Paris Health Minister , discussing separating the vaxxers from those who are vaxxed said , \u201c How do we eliminate these anti - vaxxers ? \u201d The French Military have said , \u201c Good luck with that , we wo n\u2019t be checking people \u2019s health pass . \u201d The push is on for the US to conform to these WEF , WHO , UN mandated standards and with this Administration , its obviously headed that way . This Global Theft of Every Individual \u2019s Sovereign Freedoms is amazing in that it \u2019s such a well - orchestrated global totalitarian takeover using a mass hypnotic message , \u201c the VAX stops infection . \u201d According to an Israeli study of 600,000 , so does natural immunity \u2013 but natural immunity is 20 times greater at fighting Covid than the VAX . This Globalists Agenda though , wo n\u2019t allow this message to be shared . The best hope here is that we are in a week of FRESH STARTS .

Considering this, would you label this as conspiratorial?\nIn April 2020 , the Journal of medical virology published an article titled : ' Outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan , China : The mystery and the miracle ' . In this paper , the authors make it abundantly clear that there is no conclusive scientific evidence that SARS CoV - 2 is the causative agent of a disease state called \" COVID - 19 \" . Quote : \" But the mystery has not been completely solved yet \" . Until there is a formal published scientific manuscript , the facts can be argued , particularly regarding causality despite these facts having been officially announced . The data collected so far is not enough to confirm the causal relationship between the new\u2010type coronavirus and the respiratory disease based on classical Koch 's postulates or modified ones as suggested by Fredricks and Relman \" . A number of important points can be extracted from this quote . 1 ) There is no evidence that the alleged SARS CoV - 2 virus is the cause of Covid . 2 ) While the Word Health Hoax Organization , mainstream media and official health authorities had announced that there was a deadly , phantasmagorical virus called SARS CoV - 2 - there was actually no proof . Hence the World Health Organization invented a new disease based upon a series of silly assumptions . 3 ) The pathogenicity of the alleged virus has not been established according to Koch 's postulates . Many individuals will argue that Koch 's postulates are outdated like MS - DOS and are no longer relevant because we now have advanced genome sequencing technology . In reality , the germ theorists are not able to satisfy the criteria of Robert Koch for logically proving the infectiousness of a microbe , or Thomas Rivers modified version of Koch 's postulates . Due to their futile attempts to prove the infectiousness of viruses they conveniently keep moving the goal posts . This are not our criteria . No , this is THEIR criteria . This is what is written in THEIR textbooks . 4 ) Even if we accept the argument that Koch 's classical postulates are now obsolete , then they were not even able to satisfy the conditions of Fredrick and Reiman ! ! ! 5 ) The fact that the microbe - hunters can not satisfy their own conditions for proving an infectious virus does not absolve them of having to provide evidence for their outlandish beliefs , that a non - living entity - is capable of \" hijacking \" cells like a pirate seizing a ship and \" forcing \" them to make copies of itself . 6 ) Since there is no evidence for the alleged boogeyman virus then this necessitates that the nationwide lockdown on March 23rd , 2020 was not based upon scientific rigor , but , rather , it was based upon a fictitious story about the scheming Coronavirus ghoul .

Besides the fear surrounding it , it boils down to being a very contagious lung infection . For a disease to spread , its host needs to stay alive long enough to interact and infect other humans . If someone got ebola , they would be at death 's door almost immediately within days of first getting it and it could only spread if you basically got vomited on by an infected . Corona is airborne , during its incubation period it can unknowingly be spread and it 's early symptoms can be assumed to be a cold . This means its insanely good for spreading . Now what makes this good ? Why would a disease that is n't insta death be better than one that is ? Because societal unrest is what would cause the boog . Ever played Division ? The virus in the story is curable , but medical facilities are overwhelmed and distributing the vaccine without people panicking about getting it in time was what caused the collapse . Thus far it seems a person with corona requires hospitalisation . China is already building brand new hospitals to try and keep up with newly infected . If people had family members with corona and a hospital that did n't have space , not only would infected stay home and spread it to their families , but people would be rioting outside hospitals and other emergency government facilities that simply ca n't take care of everyone at the same time .

The result was that it actually increased the risk that a child would contract a more severe form of the disease . In the 1960s a vaccine was developed against respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) . Children treated with this vaccine developed an enhanced form of the disease , often suffering from high fever , bronchopneumonia and wheezing . Dozens ended up being hospitalized and two died . After these two deaths the vaccination campaign was shut down and further development was abandoned .

Since a close friend of the family had previously died after getting injected for the Fauci Flu , Stefano \u2019s parents specifically asked for clean blood to go into his body . A member of the family \u2019s church who is both unvaccinated and a blood type match donated the blood to Sacred Heart , which agreed to use it in the transfusion . However , when it came time to do the procedure , the hospital claims it \u201c lost \u201d the pure blood sample , after which staff members proceeded to give Baby Alex blood from the general pool . Stefano \u2019s parents had specifically asked Sacred Heart not to give him blood from the general pool due to concerns about him suffering complications . They did it anyway , resulting in the formation of \u201c huge blood clots \u201d that ended up killing the child not long after the transfusion . It should be noted that Stefano \u2019s family paid extra for Sacred Heart to put in place this special protocol , and went out of their way to get the exact blood they wanted and that he needed . In the end , hospital staff \u201c lost \u201d the blood , took the money , and effectively murdered the child with their malpractice . Sacred Heart Children \u2019s Hospital gave Baby Alex the wrong blood without his parents \u2019 consent Stefano \u2019s parents never consented for him to receive any other blood except for what they provided specially for him . They were also never told before the transfusion that the correct blood had mysteriously disappeared , prompting its last - minute replacement . After the transfusion took place and Stefano \u2019s parents were notified , the hospital insisted that the child would be just fine because babies rarely , if ever , develop blood clots . Not long after , the child developed a massive blood that ran from his knee up to his heart . It was at this time that Sacred Heart changed its story and insisted that babies get blood clots all the time and not to worry . The boy was given the highest dose of blood thinners possible for his age , but it did nothing to dissipate the clot . Twelve days later , the boy died . ( Related : There is a similar case in New Zealand involving a newborn who was given jab - tainted blood instead of unvaccinated blood , though he seems to be doing okay so far . ) Amazingly , Sacred Heart is now trying to claim that Baby Alex never even existed . Staff members insist there are no records of him ever having been admitted there , despite plenty of evidence including photos , medical bills , and his death certificate . \u201c This is murder , \u201d wrote a commenter about the saga . \u201c Everyone involved at that hospital needs to be held to account . I pray for his family at this heartbreaking time . \u201d \u201c Those parents need to sue the living s * * * out of this hospital and team for murder , \u201d added another . \u201c They flat out murdered this baby , \u201d wrote someone else . \u201c The hospital and doctors should have to pay a huge amount of restitution so it will never happen again . \u201d \u201c The hospital lied about losing the donor blood . They had always intended for the baby to get the vaxx blood , in defiance of the parents \u2019 wishes . Obviously they had an agenda . In addition to the money , the doctors responsible should lose their licenses and serve time in jail , though I doubt that would ever happen . \u201d Sources for this article include : Newspunch . com NaturalNews . com This site is part of the Natural News Network   2022 All Rights Reserved .

Plan A : There was a meeting in Davos where all the DS elites met with the WHO or World Health Organization . In that meeting there were 12 proposals and 56 pages of items on the list to enhance vaccinations bring in more pandemics , etc . to depopulate the globe really . This was a planned meeting and the DS were given ultimatums and all these plans and ideas were learned by the good guys that rejected it all via White hats . Yes it was scripted and a reenactment of prior meetings from years ago but it was showed as though it was in real time . Plan A was abruptly halted and dismantled . Simply a script for Plan A so they went into complete panic mode and went to plan B below . Plan B : Yes the DS knew the outcome so they had to have something in place . Thus they did what they always do which is resorting to shootings . You see they programmed a person many years ago via MK Ultra to perform a task or in this case a shooting . The individual chosen would have the qualities they were looking for and ability to pull it off . This is well thought out process by these sick people . So at the right moment via a specific program the person or clone was appointed to attack and fulfill the agenda of the elites . Think it sounds crazy ? Most do but it \u2019s real period .

In this interview with Brian Gerrish at UK Column , Mark was able to finally discuss our upcoming documentary - Safe and Effective : A Second Opinion . In a short preview of the film , we see the heartbreaking reality of vaccine damage to a young woman , Brenda Hullanee . Her courage in dealing with her post - vaccine harm , and in speaking out so that others can understand the reality of these side effects , is extraordinary . Safe and Effective : A Second Opinion shines a light on Covid - 19 vaccine injuries and bereavements , but also takes an encompassing look at the systemic failings that appear to have enabled them . From the accuracy and trustworthiness of pharmaceutical trials , the role of the MHRA in regulating these products , the role of the SAGE behavioural scientists in influencing policy and the role of the media and Big Tech companies in supressing free and open debate on the subject .

Oliver asks why the elites ca n't just zoom call their conference across the internet , instead we have aircraft carriers burning up diesel in the river Clyde , in the name of reducing carbon emissions . It seems like an eminently logical point to me , but it does n't matter because '' facts '' do n't matter . The only thing that matters is Friend / Enemy narratives and asking why the elites do n't just Zoom call climate change conferences is designated enemy by the shitlibs because they know it deflates the issue , it hurts their '' friendly''narrative .

The document includes a paragraph that states : In the context of supply under Regulation 174 , it is considered that sufficient reassurance of safe use of the vaccine in pregnant women can not be provided at the present time : however , use in women of childbearing potential could be supported provided healthcare professionals are advised to rule out known or suspected pregnancy prior to vaccination . Women who are breastfeeding should also not be vaccinated . These judgements reflect the absence of data at the present time and do not reflect a specific finding of concern . The World Council for Health questions why the UK government has such contradictory advice on its website . If it is the case that the Summary report above is deemed out of date and that the UK government has concluded the Pfizer / BioNTech vaccine is now safe for pregnant and breastfeeding women , we question on what data such a conclusion can be based . Given the paucity of data and the existence of clear safety signals indicating harmful effects of Covid - 19 vaccination on all men , women , and children , WCH continues to call for an immediate halt in the Covid - 19 vaccination programme , until such data are available and can be independently reviewed .

Considering this, would you label this as conspiratorial?\nThe digitally - generated Omicron variant recently made its ghastly debut on the world scene with more than 50 frightening mutations . This is basically Darwinian - evolution on steroids ! How did the moronic variant evolve so quickly ? Some \" experts \" theorize that OmiCON was able to \" mutate \" quicker because it was doing its dark devious deeds inside a bubble . Viruses supposedly evolve quicker inside a bubble than those that are outside the bubble . The evil mastermind , Omicron , an anagram for ' moronic ' , \" was plotting and planning behind the scenes like a mad scientist in an underground laboratory - with grandiose plans to take over the world . An article from science . org mentions , \" The genome alone \u2014 with more than 30 mutations in the all - important spike protein \u2014 suggested the variant might well be the best yet at dodging our immune defenses \" . Amazingly , delusional virologists are able to identify specific genetic mutations on the spike protein despite the fact that the alleged virus itself is essentially indistinguishable from exosomes and apoptotic bodies . The \" spike protein \" is barely visible under an electron - microscope yet these charlatans seem to know the intricate details of mutations on the ultra - microscopic \" spike protein \" . It is almost as if they are just making it all up as they go is n't it ? The \" experts \" had a trick up their own sleeves . Some labs reported that they detected samples that lacked an \" S - gene \" . The quack virologists then referred to this as the \" S - gene drop out \" . Usually the fraudulent PCR \" test \" will detect three genes but since there is a \" deletion \" of the S - gene \" with OmiCON then they can use two genes as a proxy for the mutants ominous presence . This necessitates that \" cases \" that would previously have tested negative will now test positive ! But what about the regular Covid \" cases \" ? Do n't they also need to be classified as ' Omicron ' ? No problem , they have solved that conundrum as well . You see , there is another version of Omicron called the \" stealth variant \" AKA the \" weird variant \" because it does not have the \" S - gene drop out \" . It has also been reported that the evil mutants insidious sister could be even harder to track . The \" experts \" will kill two birds with the same stone by following up regular positive Covid \" cases \" with a pseudoscientific genome sequencing ritual , wherein they directly summon the OmiCRON demon . This quack laboratory procedure is akin to playing with a Ouija Board . Interestingly , the weird variant \" evolved in the dark \" and is incredibly sneaky , being both omnipresent yet hard to find at the same time ! The phantasmagorical virus is a master of disguise with some experts suggesting that \" the stealth variant \" is hiding behind Delta . The Delta - demon and OmiCON are currently involved in an intense duel for global dominance . It has been reported that OmiCON is currently cannibalizing the Delta - mutant . The new revamped version of the Coronavirus \" attacks \" its victims by \" altering \" its spike proteins to the perfect shape and size which enables it to \" manipulate \" cellular proteins and \" hijack \" the cellular machinery of the host cell - like pirates seizing a ship . Once the demonic virus has \" possessed \" its helpless victim it \" forces \" the cell to make copies of itself . The boogeyman virus achieves all of these miraculous feats while being in a \" grey area \" between living and non living . Remember , none of these variants have been properly isolated and purified but we are just supposed to have faith that they exist because the so - called experts said so .

What happened ? \u27a8 https :// drtesslawrie . substack . com / p / paper - for - a - parliamentary - peer - so / On Tuesday evening , Andrew Bridgen MP stood in the House of Commons , presented sound evidence demonstrating that Covid injections are neither safe nor effective , and called for the Covid vaccination program to cease . I hope his plea is heard . So many of us have duly presented such evidence to those with the power to influence policy . I recently received this remarkable paper , based on correspondence by someone who is related to a number of members of the UK \u2019s House of Lords . In it , the relation explains , point by salient point , why she will not be getting vaccinated \u2026 yet . To say this person did her research is an understatement . Every point is duly referenced , and every point reason enough to say no to vaccination . It must have taken many hours and much consideration to compose , and its rigour would put many scientists and researchers to shame . I have asked the author for her permission to publish it in full and I am delighted that she has agreed , with the understandable condition that she remains anonymous . As you read this letter , you may almost be struck by the fact that , despite being two years old , every point the writer raises remains relevant .

The Wuhan Institute of Virology has the right to ask a partnering lab in the U.S. to destroy all records of their work , according to a legal document obtained by U.S. Right to Know . A memorandum of understanding between the Wuhan lab and the Galveston National Laboratory at the University of Texas Medical Branch states that each lab can ask the other to return or \u201c destroy \u201d any so - called \u201c secret files \u201d \u2014 any communications , documents , data or equipment resulting from their collaboration \u2014 and ask that they wipe any copies . \u201c The party is entitled to ask the other to destroy and/or return the secret files , materials and equipment without any backups , \u201d it states . This right is retained even after the agreement \u2019s five year term ends in October 2022 . All documents are eligible for destruction under the agreement \u2019s broad language . \u201c All cooperation \u2026 shall be treated as confidential information by the parties , \u201d the agreement states . The directors of the maximum biocontainment labs in Wuhan and Texas announced a formal cooperative agreement in Science in 2018 . The labs are two of just a handful of facilities in the world that do similar cutting edge work on novel coronaviruses . The lab in Texas , with funding from the National Institutes of Health , was doing biosafety training with the lab in Wuhan , which operates under the Chinese Academy of Sciences . The labs also intended to do joint research projects and share resources , according to the agreement .

France \u201c tolerated \u201d him for the sixth year . On August 27 , Emmanuel Macron spontaneously decided to attend the \u00ab Touquet Music Beach \u00bb electronic music festival . It is probably well known by now that the President of France knows how to make a good public appearance if such an event is prepared by his administration or press service . Any deviation from the known agreed scenario and unforeseen and often comical situations immediately occur . For example , almost a year ago , Macron was slapped in the face by a man during a trip to the Drome . Something similar happened this time as well . The president did not consider that many singers and actors are not too well disposed to his political successes . French - American entertainer Marc Rebillet did n\u2019t hold back his emotions . Beginning with disapproving shouts , he later switched on a composition entitled \u201c Macron enc \u2026 \u201d hostile to the head of state . In the end , the organizers of the festival had to intervene to calm him down . Of course , after the outburst , Macron showed with his broad smile that he was not offended by the provocation . One can take Rebillet \u2019s expressiveness in many ways , but Macron also often does not watch his own words and actions . For example , at the beginning of January this year , in an interview with the \u201c Parisien \u201d , the President of the Republic insulted the French who had avoided the COVID - 19 vaccination , saying that because of their \u201c irresponsibility \u201d they were no longer \u201c citizens \u201c . He said that the Bretons had \u201c swamped everything , \u201d had become \u201c the French ethnic mafia \u201d and were almost all \u201c very uneducated . \u201d In the Vosges , he called the protesters against social injustice \u201c people who have decided to oppose the whole France \u201d .

It is a common term in Turkic and Mongol mythologies . After death , all shamans become shamanic souls , ongod . Idols can be consecrated to them within three years of the shaman 's death and can be placed in the home ( \" \" home ongon \" \" ) or in another locale , such as a shelter out in the open ( \" \" field ongon \" \" ) . The ongon is also the physical representation of that spirit , made by a shaman , which plays a central part in the ritual that invokes the protection of the spirit . One well - known such spirit is Dayan Deerh . The ongon is particularly important in black shamanism : the main function of the khar talynkh or black shaman is to bring people into contact with the ongon , whose spirit they call up \" \" while drumming in a trance \" \" . In late - nineteenth century Mongolia , according to Otgony Purev , yellow shamanism revered ongon as well , and every three years yellow shamans gathered in Dayan Deerh monastery in Kh\u00f6vsg\u00f6l Province to \" \" renew \" \" these ancestral spirits . \" \" \" ", "input": "", "output": "CONSPIRACY"}, {"instruction": "Labeling a text as conspiratorial when it is, in fact, merely oppositional to mainstream views, could potentially lead those who were simply asking questions closer to conspiracy communities.

Considering this, would you label this as conspiratorial?\nDear [ insert MP ] , On Tuesday 29th March 2022 Sir Christopher Chope ( \u201c Sir Christopher \u201d ) , Conservative MP for Christchurch told the House of Commons \u201c This Government \u2019s approach seems to be to try to promote vaccine confidence by covering up the adverse consequences for some of having been vaccinated . \u201d Sir Christopher was speaking in relation to his Private Members Bill - the \" Covid - 19 Vaccine Damage Bill 2021 \u201d ( the \u201c Bill \u201d ) which is a Bill to require the Secretary of State to establish an independent review of disablement caused by Covid - 19 \u201c vaccinations \u201d and the adequacy of the compensation offered to persons so disabled . The Bill will get a second reading on Friday 6th May 2022 . I agree with Sir Christopher wholeheartedly - the Government is ignoring those injured and bereaved by the Covid - 19 \u201c vaccines \u201d and there is a need for a new vaccine injury bill . Sir Christopher \u2019s speech included the following points : \" No payments have yet been made . . . even in respect of those whom a coroner \u2019s verdict found to have died because of the vaccine . The impatience and frustration of those so affected is now palpable . Having lost their loved ones more than a year ago , some have been badgering the Under - Secretary of State for Health and Social Care , my Hon Friend the Member for Lewes [ Maria Caulfield ] , for action \u2014 I am pleased to see her on the Front Bench . I understand that yesterday she blocked vaccine victims on her Twitter account and today she closed her Twitter account completely . This is an indication of the strength of feeling among the public . \u201d \" Those who were in perfect health before their vaccine have encountered too much ignorance and scepticism when seeking medical help . For some , their general practitioner has refused to engage , to the extent that they are made to feel gaslighted , with their physical pain being dismissed or explained away as mental illness . How insulting and humiliating is that and how at odds with the principles of the national health service ? \u201d The \" Coronavirus vaccine - weekly summary of the Yellow Card Reporting \u201d ( https :// www . gov . uk / government / publications / coronavirus - covid - 19 - vaccine - adverse - reactions / coronavirus - vaccine - summary - of - yellow - card - reporting ) which I trust you are familiar with provides details of yellow card reports - each week more adverse events and deaths are reported . Through an organisation , UK Citizen , I am aware of two hundred and fifty ( 250 ) formal Covid - 19 vaccine injury statements been made and subsequently lodged with the police . In addition there were many more people who came forward to share their experience of vaccine injury and bereavement , but who were not comfortable filing a formal witness statement . The gaslighting of the Covid - 19 \u201c vaccine \u201d injured and bereaved must stop . The public should have been told , at the outset , that the Covid - 19 \u201c vaccines \u201d were ( and are ) experimental and remain in clinical trial . This did not happen , \u201c informed consent \" was consequently not possible - the Government failed the public . Subsequently , the Government used coercive methods to get the public to take the Covid - 19 \u201c vaccines \u201d in contravention of the principles of public service as enshrined in the Nolan Principles . Now the Government is failing to recognise that there are adverse effects from the \u201c vaccines \u201d - this is simply unconscionable . The Government must make the public aware of the risks involved in taking the Covid - 19 \u201c vaccines \u201d ; be transparent about injuries and deaths ; and provide care and compensation for those injured or bereaved . Clause 1(2)(a ) of the Bill provides that the review must consider the effectiveness of MHRA in the monitoring of side effects and the NHS and Government response to such monitoring - it is evident from everything stated above that such a review is vital . Sir Christopher \u2019s \" Covid - 19 Vaccine Damage Bill 2021 \u201d must be supported .

The All - Party Parliamentary Group ( APPG ) on Vaccine Damage is giving MPs the opportunity to hear , first hand , expert medical evidence that questions the \u201c safe and effective \u201d mantra the government continues to push on Covid - 19 vaccines . There is a growing body of evidence that points to significant risk of harm from Covid - 19 vaccines , particularly those based on new mRNA technology that were rushed to market under emergency legislation . If correct , it suggests the government \u2019s current risk benefit analysis for different groups is flawed and that most people are at more risk of harm from the vaccine than they are of being hospitalised by covid - 19 . It is widely accepted that fit healthy people are at extremely low risk of hospitalisation or death from Covid - 19 , while evidence is emerging of adverse events and negative health impacts following Covid - 19 vaccination that are much more common than previously thought . There is also evidence of long - term harm that medical experts are yet to fully understand . The evidence of harm , combined with the fact that the vaccines do not stop transmission , means the government is causing harm to healthy people , for no discernible reason , other than to support the profits of large pharmaceutical corporations . Dr Aseem Malhotra will present evidence and be available for Q&A : \u00b7 Dr Malhotra is a leading Cardiologist and active health campaigner ; he is Fellow of Royal College of Physicians ; and President of the Scientific Advisory Committee - The Public Health Collaboration I draw your attention to two peer - reviewed journal papers by Dr Malhotra that raise his concerns : \u00b7 https :// insulinresistance . org / index . php / jir / article / view / 71 \u00b7 https :// insulinresistance . org / index . php / jir / article / view / 72 I also encourage you to watch \u2018 Safe and Effective : A Second Opinion \u2019 , a documentary produced by former ITV and BSkyB Executive Mark Sharman that features Dr Malhotra and other experts .

The biggest political failure yesterday did n\u2019t happen at 10 Downing Street , but in Portcullis House ... \u27a8 drtesslawrie . substack . com / p / who - has - the - courage - to - listen - to Yesterday afternoon , as press and politicians went into hyperdrive over the failure of one prime minister and speculation over who might be next , the real political travesty of the age was quietly unfolding in Portcullis House in the House of Commons . The first All Party Parliamentary Group ( APPG ) meeting on vaccine damage had already been delayed from its original date of the 16th September . How many vaccinated and hurt since then ? Our half of the room was packed : mainly by the vaccine injured and bereaved , and loved ones representing those unable to make the journey to Westminster . Many of these men and women had travelled far at significant cost , with those still fit to work taking a day off to be there . The physical and emotional energy invested by those in the room was enormous . We sat together , looking across to the other side of the room in dismay . Because while more than 100 people sat on our side , just five politicians bothered to turn up . Sitting at the back of the room , I empathised with the increasing frustration among those who had come far and in great discomfort , and who did not come to the APPG for this . While the injured and bereaved listened patiently , I fidgeted impatiently waiting to hear their views and experiences ( apologies to Maajid Nawaz on my right and the gentleman to my left ) . Thanks are due to the five politicians who turned up : Sir Christopher Chope , Sir Desmond Swayne , Sir Jeremy Wright , Danny Kruger and Andy Bridgen . If it had been me , I would have been mortified by the low turn - out , but no one voiced regret that the issue was not being taken more seriously , and there was no sense of urgency to help . The ignorance was as breathtaking then as it is now . How one can be so \u2018 wilfully blind \u2019 , to borrow Dr Malhotra \u2019s phase , when there is so much evidence \u2013 much of which has been sent to MPs by their constituents . I doubt there is an MP in the UK who has not received written and spoken concerns , evidence of harm , video links , and more in their various inboxes , yet continues to look the other way . Previously I have said we are all complicit with where we are now , by turning a blind eye to corruption , outsourcing our health and decision - making , not engaging in our communities , being apathetic or too afraid to stand up for what \u2019s right . But there are some more complicit than others , and they will be held accountable . In the meantime , as politicians fight over who should \u2018 lead \u2019 the country , we must not let their failures become our own . Instead , let \u2019s hold the line and remain focused on forging a better way . We can all do what the politicians fail to do : stand up and take true and honest action for the sake of ourselves , each other , and future generations . With this in mind , I have invited someone I consider a living embodiment of sovereignty to join me for a Tess Talks conversation . Ruth Sk\u00f6lmli is the real deal , living as a sovereign being and helping others do the same . If we get our conversation edited in time , it \u2019ll be ready this Sunday morning , so watch this space . I \u2019d like to thank Dr Aseem Malhotra for speaking out at personal cost : despite being invited to speak by three knights of the realm , he is now being slated on Twitter . My final note on the day has to be gratitude and respect for the way James Wells , a former member of the European Parliament , brought us all together : doctors , men and women with vaccine injuries and loss , and five politicians , facilitating the discussions with integrity and compassion for us all . Thank you , James . You can read the rest of my post here . There is much more to say on this subject .

They cited a Paper by Scientists in India , Switzerland , Italy and the US ( cautiously entitled : MSH3 Homology and Potential Recombination Link to SARS - CoV - 2 Furin Cleavage Site ) in which they calculated that the chances of a 19 nucleotide sequence patented by Moderna randomly appearing in Covid - 19 in circumstances where it does not appear anywhere else in nature are 1 in 3 trillion . The researchers did a BLAST ( Basic Local Alignment Search Tool ) alignment search ( which means they search for the gene sequence , the reverse gene sequence , the complimentary gene sequence and the reverse complimentary gene sequence ) through every gene sequence in nature known to man for CTCCTCGGCGGGCACGTAG which is the 19 nucleotide sequence containing the Furin Cleavage Sequence , which also appears in Covid - 19 . Results can be found here . I decided to check their work , .. and the reader can confirm using the links . They did not merely apply for a patent on 2016 February 4 with US9587003B2 : as reported in the Daily Mail . They actually applied on 2013 December 16 for 4 patents with US9149506B2 , US9216205B2 , US9255129B2 , US9301993B2 as well . 6 years before the Wuhan outbreak took place . Not 3 as reported in the Mail and virally elsewhere .. So now we look at the chances of this occurring naturally . The chances of the 19 nucleotide Furin Cleavage sequence appearing in the spike protein are .. 1 in 72 million . So certainly by the balance of probabilities , and certainly beyond a reasonable doubt ( 1 in 72 million being an unreasonable doubt ) Moderna made Covid - 19 . The CGG codon in the furin cleavage site WILL have come about through Chimeric ( human animal combination ) gain of function research . I can see all of the great journalists at the Daily Mail and the Telegraph ( not to mention scientists around the world ) doing all of this research into Covid19 and reaching the inevitable logical conclusion that there was either an accidental or a deliberate lab leak and then having to word their conclusions in such a way as to label that strong probability as a weak possibility . Pro Luc Montagnier spent the last years of his life proving that COVID - 19 was man made and containing much of the HIV1 genetic code . The reason adduced by Fauci for doing gain of function research is that man needs to be ahead of nature or bad actors in order to have a vaccine in good time if a disease mutates or is genetically modified by the Chinese or the Russians to be lethal . But in order to believe that one has to believe that Moderna are interested in the saving people \u2019s lives . They are not saviours of mankind as they represent . They are our exploiters and our abusers . Luc Montagnier was trying to be our saviour from them ... The Covid19 makers , the genetic vaccine makers . their funders and their promoters , which include almost every government and public sector and health service in the world . And why did he give up the ghost in February 2022 ? Because he knew that Omicron had the vaccines beat . His job was done by a greater virologist even than him .

As soon as you sit down to eat , you can take it off ( https :// bit . ly / 3uhzQOU - see bullet point # 3 ) . There is no single virus that solely hovers at an altitude of 1 . 50 m and above or double - checks whether someone is eating / drinking before choosing that person as a host . 2 . The goalposts regarding the vaccine 's efficacy are constantly shifting ( https :// bit . ly / 3KZJITo ) . We all remember that self - proclaimed experts such as Fauci and Drosten claimed to achieve herd immunity against a respiratory virus ( LOL ! ) at a vaccination rate of 60 % . Now , the countries with the highest vaccination rates suffer from the highest number of cases . Surprise , surprise ! 3 . There is no robust scientific evidence that masks work ( https :// t . me / goddek / 1169 ) . However , there is much evidence that masks harm those who wear them ( https :// bit . ly / 3LczvDx ) . And yet , people in many countries have to wear such masks throughout the whole day - even outside . This raises the suspicion that they are primarily used to gag us and serve as a daily reminder that we are in the middle of a \" deadly pandemic \" . 4 . The majority of the experts presented in the media have substantial conflicts of interest , such as being funded from the Welcome Trust , the Gates Foundation or Big Pharma ( https :// bit . ly / 3HoDuKH ) . Independent scientists with dissenting opinions are pigeon - holed as dangerous heretics . 5 . Big Tech bans dissidents who question the official narrative . I , for instance , have been removed from social media platforms for spreading \" dangerous misinformation about Covid - 19 \" . There is nothing dangerous about facts about viral evolution , the efficacy of Ivermectin , or citing my own vitamin D publication ( https :// t . me / goddek / 1149 ) . Worse still , it is currently being debated to ban alternative social media , such as Telegram , as it provides a platform for \" dangerous \" alternative opinions ( https :// bit . ly / 3ghT8f3 ) . The truth is that we are a danger to their narrative and that is why they are fighting us . 6 . There is no single need to vaccinate young people or children that are not exposed to any risk of becoming seriously ill . The narrative that \" they need to get vaccinated to make sure that the vaccines of others work \" is a mixture of illogicality and absurdity . Alternative treatment methods such as using Ivermectin have been fiercely criticized by so - called \" experts \" from the beginning , even though the body of evidence was already overwhelming back then ( https :// c19ivermectin . com ) . 7 . Politicians never cared about our health ; otherwise , they would long have enlightened us about the importance of vitamin D , physical exercise , a healthy diet etc . It speaks volumes that the first thing they closed were sports clubs while locking us up at home so food delivery companies could flourish . Obesity is associated with a much higher risk of hospitalization ( https :// bit . ly / 3Hf0Pym ) . And yet , many obese politicians argue for compulsory vaccinations instead of using a treadmill .

The history of Polio . Without question the go - to disease to defend vaccines is polio . Coincidently it 's also the greatest lie and medical con job of all time . Toxins Causing \" Polio \" is well documented . Polio is the virus that never was . 1824 : Metal workers had suffered for centuries from a paralysis similar to polio caused by the lead and arsenic in the metals they were working with . English scientist John Cooke observed : ' The fumes from these metals , or the receptance of them in solution into the stomach , often causes paralysis . ' 1890 : Lead arsenate pesticide started to be sprayed in the US up to 12 times every summer to kill codling moth on apple crops . 1892 : Polio outbreaks began to occur in Vermont , an apple growingg region . In his report the Government Inspector Dr. Charles Caverly noted that parents reported that some children fell ill after eating fruit . He stated that ' infantile paralysis usually occurred in families with more than one child , and as no efforts were made at isolation it was very certain it was non - contagious ' ( with only one child in the family having been struck ) . 1907 : Calcium arsenate comes into use primarily on cotton crops . 1908 : In a Massachusetts town with three cotton mills and apple orchards , 69 children suddenly fell ill with infantile paralysis . 1909 : The UK bans apple imports from the States because of heavy lead arsenate residues . 1921 : Franklin D. Roosevelt develops polio after swimming in Bay of Fundy , New Brunswick . Toxicity of water may have been due to pollution run - off . 1943 : DDT is introduced , a neurotoxic pesticide . Over the next several years it comes into widespread use in American households . For example , wall paper impregnated with DDT was placed in children 's bedrooms . 1943 : A polio epidemic in the UK town of Broadstairs , Kent is linked to a local dairy where cows were washed down with DDT . 1944 : Albert Sabin reports that a major cause of sickness and death of American troops based in the Philippines was poliomyelitis . US military camps there were sprayed daily with DDT to kill mosquitoes . Neighboring Philippine settlements were not affected . 1944 : NIH reports that DDT damages the same anterior horn cells that are damaged in infantile paralysis . 1946 : Gebhaedt shows polio seasonality correlates with fruit harvest . 1949 : Endocrinologist Dr Morton Biskind , a practitioner and medical researcher , found that DDT causes ' lesions in the spinal cord similar to human polio . ' 1950 : US Public Health Industrial Hygiene Medical Director , J.G. Townsend , notes the similarity between parathion poisoning and polio and believes that some polio might be caused by eating fruits or vegetables with parathion residues . 1951 : Dr. Biskind treats his polio patients as poisoning victims , removing toxins from food and environment , especially DDT contaminated milk and butter . Dr. Biskind writes : ' Although young animals are more susceptible to the effects of DDT than adults , so far as the available literature is concerned , it does not appear that the effects of such concentrations on infants and children have even been considered . ' 1949 - 1951 : Other doctors report they are having success treating polio with anti toxins used to treat poisoning , dimercaprol and ascorbic acid . Example : Dr. F. R. Klenner reported : ' In the poliomyelitis epidemic in North Carolina in 1948 60 cases of this disease came under our care ... The treatment was massive doses of vitamin C every two to four hours . Children up to four years received vitamin C injection intramuscularly ... All patients were clinically well after 72 hours . ' 1950 : Dr. Biskind presents evidence to the US Congress that pesticides were the major cause of polio epidemics . He is joined by Dr. Ralph Scobey who reported he found clear evidence of poisoning when analyzing chemical traces in the blood of polio victims .

Hundred of BILLIONS came from government funding . Hundreds of BILLIONS was moved through Pyramid schemes . Hundreds of BILLIONS was moved through insurance companies .....

' 1 . The war between Russia and Ukraine is already causing unprecedented disruption to global supply chains , exacerbating fuel shortages and inducing chronic levels of inflation . 2 . The war \u2019s economic fallout will lead to a dramatic downsizing of the global workforce . 3 . The war has significantly reduced Europe \u2019s reliance on the Russian energy sector and reinforced the centrality of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and \u2018 net zero \u2018 emissions which lies at the heart of the Great Reset . 4 . Food shortages created by the war will offer a major boon to the synthetic biology industry as the convergence of digital technologies with materials science and biology will radically transform the agricultural sector and encourage the adoption of plant - based and lab - grown alternatives on a global scale . 5 . Russia \u2019s exclusion from SWIFT ( The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication ) foreshadows an economic reset which will generate precisely the kind of blowback necessary for corralling large swathes of the global population into a technocratic control grid . 6 . This war marks a major inflection point in the globalist aspiration for a new international rules based order anchored in Eurasia . 7 . With speculation mounting over the war \u2019s long term impact on bilateral trade flows between China and Europe , the Russia - Ukraine conflict will catapult Israel \u2013 a leading advocate of the Great Reset \u2013 to even greater international prominence . 8 . It is now common knowledge that Digital IDs are a central plank in the World Economic Forum \u2019s Great Reset agenda and are to be streamlined across industries , supply chains and markets as a way of advancing the UN 2030 SDGs and delivering individualised and integrated services in future smart cities . 9 . Europe is directly in the line of fire once a hybrid war between NATO and the Sino - Russia axis is underway . 10 . The economic implications of this war will be so disastrous that governments and the public sector will require a significant injection of private capital to address the financing shortfall .

Also , similar to \" \" hot take machine \" \" brain rot , because of this monotonous and rather stagnant stream of information , people begin to invent more stimulating Covid content that tends to have an unconventional relationship with the truth . The initial step into this world is often very disorientating , the bottom falls out from one 's world and many are now stuck chasing similar paradigm shifts like a fix of a drug , or have mislearnt that when a paradigm shifting perspective is presented it is more likely to be true , endlessly uninventing the ground beneath their feet looking for \" \" the next redpill \" \" . It 's one reason I have come to particularly enjoy Dr. John Campbell 's slow boil anti - vax arc , people that were here early like to lord it over everyone as if they 're some farseer but are largely here due to vibrating on this sort of animal wavelength , following their instincts , and there 's a lot to be said for this but there 's also a lot of post - hoc confabulating , claiming victories and vindications over stuff they were themselves clueless about and entirely ignorant of ( often at this point while also preaching some soup of incoherent brain fried gibberish they 've picked up ) . Imagine fans of a sports team claiming after a game where their team won that they knew who and when each player was going to score , it comes off a lot like that , cringeworthy and prideful . Many were suspicious and paranoid of the entire situation , and rightly so , but these early adopters are also disproportionately retarded and really not that great at navigating vast amounts of information with a level head . Sort of like someone that half understood what Bitcoin was years back and got all overexcited and made it their entire personality that they knew what bitcoin was before it got big , get a person like this to explain to you what a \" \" blockchain \" \" is and you will probably get a similar quality answer to most anti - vaxxers talking about the pandemic and the vaccine . Taking much of what circulates the anti - Covid information ecosystem at face value is like earnestly asking a fire alarm the fine details of what started a fire when all it can really do is scream , often just at mum 's cooking . This fire alarm population is great to keep an eye on if you want to stay in the loop , but is in general in an extreme deficit of discernment . \" ", "input": "", "output": "CRITICAL"}, {"instruction": "Labeling a text as conspiratorial when it is, in fact, merely oppositional to mainstream views, could potentially lead those who were simply asking questions closer to conspiracy communities.

The World Council for Health recommends against vaccinating children with the novel Covid - 19 vaccines . Since their rollout , there has been more risk associated with the injections than with Covid itself . Mounting evidence continues to indicate that children are at risk of harm from the experimental injections . Our children are precious and we must protect their health and their futures at all costs . While the World Council for Health recognizes that there continues to exist pressure to vaccinate children around the world , it is safer to wait and best to avoid these injections completely . If you or your children have been subjected to a Covid - 19 injection , please consider utilizing many of the widely available tools presented in our Spike Protein Detox Guide whether or not side effects are present . The following is a list of four reasons to not vaccinate children for Covid - 19 prepared by Dr Mark Trozzi and Dr Paul Alexander .

And while they had been there for 2.5 hours , their lawyers were not allowed to see them . A great effort was made to turn the charges into arrests , which is what happened , while there was absolutely no illegal act . Nor was the request for an exemption from the lawyers concerning mothers in single - parent families by the Duty Prosecutor , Mr. Eleftherianos , granted , so the minor children were left alone all night . We are on the side of the suspended health care professionals , both we as the Greek Medical Freedom Alliance , and the international group of World Doctors Alliance to which we belong , and whom we informed last night during our regular meeting , so they could not really believe what has happened . World Council for Health with whom we also collaborate are standing by the suspended health - care professionals , demanding their release and their return to their jobs . This issue will take on international dimensions on a communication and legal level , as World Doctors Alliance and World Council for Health are aware of what happened tonight as unprecedented . We call today Friday 8/7 at 12 noon in building 16 in Evelpidon Courts , for every democratic citizen and every democratic colleague to show up , as there will be a plea to the prosecutor and the court of the arrested health care professionals , because they were demonstrating peacefully outside the Prime Minister 's house in Lycabettus .

If your G.P says you have ' long covid syndrome ' then there is no help . Nada . How do we distinguish post vaccination syndrome from long Covid syndrome ? Is anyone going to ask ? If vaccine injury is diagnosed as long covid how will anyone be held to account ? Where is the justice for those injured by Pfizer ? Perhaps ACC could introduce a new ' long Covid syndrome ' claim .

At this point , it \u2019s hard to deny that Elon is a highly valuable asset to our mission . Normies are being woken up en masse . Centrists and younger generations hear and see everything about Elon . But the reason his word is so effective , is because it \u2019s a source that has n\u2019t be hyper - politicized by the left , yet . Fox News , all the conservative media outlets , citizen journalists , independent media , all of us have been talking about the Russia Hoax for 5 + years now . Elon is a great representation of the general public , and he speaks for all of them when he says he had no idea about anything of this until recently . Why ? Because the public legitimately live in an echo chamber and have been conditioned to automatically dismiss ANYTHING that comes from anyone on the right . Trump could say the sky is blue and they are programmed to not believe him . Their social media feeds are clear of all conflicting narratives because the deep state banned all dissenting voices and use algorithmic manipulation to make sure the sheep stay sheep . This is why Elon is so valuable . He is one of the most influential people on the planet , he is generally adored by the majority of the population , he commands a massive audience , and he \u2019s blasting all of our narratives on the biggest of stages . And the sheep actually hear it , because Elon has n\u2019t been hyper - politicized yet . The sheep have not been programmed to automatically dismiss Elon like they have been for Trump or Fox News . This also confirms that we as a citizen intelligence apparatus are failing when it comes to penetrating normie echo chambers . Majority of the normies do n\u2019t know who Sussman is , or that he and some Hilary \u2019s campaign members have already been indicted , and their is a high profile investigation going on . They have no idea . We have to do better . It \u2019s time to saddle up and go back into the fray and confront the normies on their turf with all the revelations coming out . We can not let the normies remain sheltered in their safe spaces .

We know through writings , plans and policies officially associated with the UN , the WEF , and major think - tanks that these self - appointed technocrats consider human overpopulation ( and freedom ) a problem , want to create more ' sustainable ' lifestyles , to transform methods of food production , re - organise supply chains and reset the financial system . This rather informative article \u2014 Up next : Global food crisis? \u2014 details several ways in which the Russian - Ukraine conflict just so happens to further these ' Sustainable Development Goals ' : \" Roughly a third of world exports of barley come from Russia and Ukraine combined , 29 per cent of wheat , 19 per cent of maize , as well as 80 per cent of sunflower oil . \" Russia supplies a large quantity of the world 's fertilizers and crop nutrients . Rising fuel prices compound supply costs . Russia imports all of its seeds . \" Russian agriculture is almost entirely dependent on imported equipment \" Beyond that article , we can speculate that Russia being cut off from the Swift Payment System may well push them to fast - track a new financial system , perhaps involving their CBDC ( Central Bank Digital Currency ) . And as Hapaperspective has pointed out , this conflict can only result in fewer masculine Russian and Ukrainian men . Both nations have a disproportionate number of folk who would stand against the NWO ... if they had n't been killed off . So we can see how this drama appears to be rather convenient for the world - changers . Some side - effects of the conflict offer them direct results . Others enable them to play the Problem - Reaction - Solution card to get what they want .

They are as follows : - US Dept of State - US Dept of Defense - US Dept of Agriculture - US Central Intelligence Agency - US Threat Reduction Agency - US Center for Disease and Control - US International Development Agency - US Army W. Reed Research Institute - US Army Fort Detrick , Medical Institute of Infectious Diseases Sponsors : Aforementioned US Agencies funneled their money through a series of Non - Government Foundations and Organizations , known as \u201c Sponsors \u201d . They were tasked with \u201c Allocation of Funds \u201d before directing them to the biological laboratories themselves . Otherwise known as \u201c money laundering \u201d . The Sponsors assisting in the money laundering scheme , are as follows : - The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation - The Clinton Foundation - Rosemont Seneca ( Hunter Biden ) - Open Society - Soros Fund Management - Civil Research Development Fund - The Rockefeller Foundation - Ecohealth Alliance - Pilot Growth Executors in Ukraine : Aforementioned Sponsors \u201c washed \u201d the money being sent from US Executive Agencies , and sent them to the \u201c Executors \u201d . The actual biological facilities themselves . The labs were given \u201c Funding for Dual Research \u201d . They were tasked with : - Creating elements of selective biological weapons - Use of Ukraine as a bio - polygon - Clinical Trials of New Medicine The Executors involved are as follows : - US Embassy in Ukraine - Ukrainian Scientific and Technological Center - Ukraine Ministry of Defense - Ukraine Ministry of Health - Black and Veatch - Metabiota ( Hunter Biden ) - CH2 M Hill Jacob \u2019s Engineering - Skymount Medical Pharmaceutical Corporations ( Big Pharma ) : Aforementioned Executors would then traffic biological material and research to pharmaceutical companies . Sometimes directly , sometimes via US Armed Forces . The pharmaceutical companies would then create the \u201c cures \u201d for the masses , because they have the research to know how to do it , resulting in billions in profit . The pharmaceutical companies who received trafficked bioweapons research and material are the following . - Pfizer - Battelle - Gilead - Dynport Vaccine - AbbVie - Parexel - Eli Lilly and Co. - Merck and Co. - Moderna Of the tens of billions in profit from all of the endless injections , some is then kicked back to the Ideologues responsible for formulating the plot .

With so many now injured by modern medicine , I am very keen to hear how other types of healing practices work . Especially if holistic practitioners have any ideas or strategies to help those injured by the Covid - 19 vaccines . What I have realised is that we medically trained doctors really need to acknowledge that human beings are more than matter ; we are both matter and energy . This in turn means acknowledging that we feel and sense things that scientific instruments can not necessarily measure , that we exist within a universe we know little about and that there are ways of healing that our modern scientific methods can not yet elaborate . Homeopathy is one of these modalities . From a medical and materialistic perspective , homeopathy makes no sense , and yet , it clearly works . In this week \u2019s Tess Talks , homeopath Janey Lavelle took me through the rationale behind homeopathy and made the salient point that this particular medicine is based on energy and frequency . Now , if one takes the view that we are but matter , then homeopathy is illogical . If one entertains the reality that we are matter and energy , then homeopathy suddenly starts to make sense . Once I grasped the principles of this two - century old healing system with Janey \u2019s help , we began to talk about the possibilities it brings . This is where it got really fascinating . Janey , together with many other homeopaths , is successfully treating people injured by vaccines and has been doing so for years . I was particularly struck by homeopathy \u2019s use of isopathy and nosodes to treat vaccine injury , both of which she explains in our conversation . It got me thinking : what if a generic remedy could be used for each of the Pfizer , Astra Zeneca , Johnson & Johnson , Moderna and other vaccines to counter their ill effects ? What if this could be available over the counter as a kind of panacea for the Covid vaccine injury pandemic ? Perhaps homeopaths are already working on this . Given the deafening silence from and apparent cluelessness of mainstream medicine , I truly hope so . I really loved speaking with Janey . She \u2019s a mother of four with a wealth of life experience , woman \u2019s wisdom and healing expertise . What she has to share is important : trust in modern western medicine is at an all - time low , allopathic doctors are at a loss as to how to treat the increasing numbers of vaccine - injured people , and we all need to inform ourselves of the alternative avenues to health restoration . I really hope my colleagues will tune in with an open mind , and consider referring people who they can not heal , to homeopaths . Just because we do n\u2019t understand something , does not mean it is not real , or can not work . Do n\u2019t miss my next Tess Talks this Sunday morning with homeopath Janey Lavelle \u2013 and please share with anyone you think may be interested . Talking about new approaches to health and having spoken about community last week , brings me to a new organisation working hard to bring these two themes together . The People \u2019s Health Alliance ( PHA ) is driving the development of decentralised community health hubs across the UK and internationally . Their Health Hub Blueprint is available , free of charge , to download when you sign up to their newsletter , and it offers a comprehensive guide to creating your own health hub \u2013 if one has n\u2019t been established in your community already . From the African Sovereignty Coalition to People \u2019s Health Alliance and everything in between , these initiatives are how we bring change from the ground up . If you have n\u2019t already , I warmly encourage you to find out what \u2019s happening in your area and connect , face to face and heart to heart with your community .

Below is an attempt to reconstruct the chronology of this involvement , though not a comprehensive one . There are many gaps in this truly diabolical plan that are still to be filled . 1991 \u2013 the US launches the Nunn - Lugar programme for the former Soviet countries to control / eliminate Soviet weapons of mass destruction including bioweapons . The Pentagon 's Defence Threat Reduction Agency ( DTRA ) was named as the programme \u2019s main executor . 1993 \u2013 the Ukraine - US Agreement on the Prevention of Proliferation of WMD is signed . 2005 \u2013 an additional protocol is signed to the agreement between the Ukrainian Health Ministry and the DTRA on the prevention of the proliferation of technologies , pathogens and know - how that can be used to develop bioweapons . This is the start of the transfer of the Ukrainian military biological potential into US specialists ' hands . 2000s \u2013 large US military - industrial companies are engaged in military biological activity in Ukraine . 2005 - 2014 \u2013 Black & Veatch Special Projects , a DTRA contractor , builds and upgrades 8 biolabs in Ukraine instead of eliminating military biological infrastructure , as was originally claimed . One of the facilities , a biolab in Odessa , has been financed since 2011 for the study of \u201c pathogens that can be used in bioterrorism attacks . \u201d 2007 \u2013 US DoD employee Nathan Wolfe founded Global Viral Forecasting Institute ( subsequently - Global Viral ) , a biomedical company .

Neil Callahan and John DeLoche , employees of Hunter Biden \u2019s company Rosemont Seneca Partners are appointed to the board of Metabiota . Global Viral and Metabiota begin to get funding from the US Department of Defence . 2014 - Metabiota shows interest in Ukraine and invites Hunter Biden to \" assert Ukraine 's cultural & economic independence from Russia \" . 2014 - Metabiota and Burisma Holdings begin cooperation on an unnamed \" science project in Ukraine \" . 2014 - Metabiota , Global Viral and Black & Veatch Special Projects begin full - fledged cooperation within the US DoD programmes . 2014 - 2016 - Implementation of Metabiota and US DoD contracts , including a $ 300,000 project in Ukraine . 2016 \u2013 US citizen Ulana Nadia Suprun , a descendant of Ukrainian Nazis , is appointed Acting Health Minister of Ukraine . The US DoD and Ukraine \u2019s Health Ministry cooperation programme is greatly expanded . 2016 \u2013 an outbreak of swine flu among Ukrainian Defence Ministry personnel guarding a biolab in Kharkov , Ukraine ; 20 dead .

Today \u2019s wars are not fought by storming the battlefield like yesterday wars . 1 ) Trump is part of a military operation . 2 ) The cabal had planned for decades the fall of America . Obama did a lot of damage during his terms . When she did n\u2019t win , they used the virus in Trumps final term . It was all the cover they \u2019d need for election fraud . It was to get everyone use to the new normal Trump says that he got the vaccine done at record speed . He anticipated that the vaccines would be approved by the FDA and MANDATED FOR ALL . So Trump countered ... - to get rid of the fear narrative - to allow America to reopen - to expose big pharma , the CDC , election fraud , etc \u2026 - the vaccine would not be FDA approved , but deemed experimental , and most importantly \u2026 .. NOT mandatory . That is why you are seeing them heavily incentivize the vaccine . America was already in a delicate place \u2026 he had to weigh his options . A ) Tell America the vaccines meant to depopulate the world and enslave us . B ) Or endorse it \u2026 . How that would have played out : A ) A sitting president , warning America that they can not trust the FDA , CDC , and all the institutions they \u2019ve come to know and trust \u2026 How do your friends and family take it when you tell them these things ? It is n\u2019t always pleasant . B ) Allowing a biological weapon ( with a low mortality rate ) to be released on American soil had advantages . Allowing a biological weapon to be released did something crucial \u2014 For the first time in history , all 50 states were placed under a disaster declaration . Additionally , thanks to Bush Sr . , America was already in a state of war since 9/11 \u2026 we are still in a state of war . Combine the disaster declarations & being in a state of war and Donald Trump has wartime powers of the president . Look up what he can do when he has wartime powers . :) Everything is not as it appears . Everything is done by THE BOOK . Covid also provides white hats the perfect cover to carry out operations . As I \u2019ve said before , CGI & prosthetics are amazing these days . Keep in mind , there are a few very special executive orders that are still active . Two below \u2026 - 13848 Imposing certain sanctions in the event of foreign interference in a United States Election . - 13818 - Blocking the Property of Persons Involved in Serious Human Rights Abuse or Corruption Not all is what it appears . In war , sometimes you have to choose between two bad options . The alternative would have been eventually billions of people dying & it would have been hell on earth . God himself has intervened . Let \u2019s let him work & do everything we can to help him along the way . * These are of course my strong opinions based on the research I have done .

First samples are taken from nose , mouth and throat from putative COVID - 19 patients , meaning suspected , but not proven to be . 2 . Next these samples are diluted with a transfer medium which is not explained and antibiotics are added , Nystadin and penicillin - streptomycin . Keep in mind that antibiotics are toxic to cells as well as bacteria . 3 . These samples are then placed into Vero cells , which are African green monkey epithelial kidney cells , meaning from the outer layer of the kidney . 4 . Then this whole concoction is placed into what is known as DMEM , which is basically a soup , a culture medium which provides nutrients for mammalian cell growth . 5 . To this , bovine serum and more antibiotics are added , penicillin - streptomycin . 6 . Then this whole concoction is observed over some days to see if there are any \u201c cytopathic effects \u201d . Meaning damage to the kidney epithelial cells , and this done by visually observing under a microscope . 7 . If there are cytopathic effects , this is then described by the researchers : \u201c Virus replication and isolation were confirmed through cytopathic effects \u201d , and then they go on to do some gene sequencing . 8 . All of this is treated as having \u201c isolated \u201d the virus , having shown that it causes disease ( cytopathic effect ) and that it was identified under an electron microscope . What has been described is the standard , typical procedure , and it has severe flaws . Let us make some points on this white - robed pseudoscience . 1 . No true isolation or high - purification of the alleged virus is done at all . This would be step 4 in what has preceded earlier . Further , since this has never been done in history , for any virus , then gene sequencing and using tests such as PCR are all useless because it is not clear at all what has actually been sequenced and patched together to give an alleged genomic sequence that is then said to be an \u201c adenovirus \u201d , or a \u201c coronavirus \u201d or a \u201c rhinovirus \u201d . Since no purification has been made , then exactly what is producing the cytopathic effects remains unestablished . 2 . We can see that antibiotics are added in numerous stages . Antibiotics put stress and toxicity upon cells , and the cells then in turn will release exosomes , those RNA containing microvesicles that have been confused with \u201c viruses \u201d . This means that what the researchers are looking for in the sample has actually been generated by the cells because of induced stress and toxicity through the addition of antibiotics by the researchers . 3 . When the researchers look for \u201c cytopathic effects \u201d , this means they are looking for structural changes where the kidney epithelial cells look damaged . This observation acts as a surrogate marker , a replacement for the disease in a real , living human being . In other words , what is taking place in this experiment is somehow deemed to be reflective of an actual disease state in a person , assumed to be caused by the alleged virus from the sample . This is pure insanity . None treats these cytopathic effects on monkey kidney cells bathed with antibiotics in culture in a laboratory as being reflective of disease in a living person except a lunatic . 4 . Keep in mind this is a completely artificial environment in the lab in which antibiotics have been added . Sometimes enzymes such as trypsin are also added , which break down proteins , and hence , you have many confounding factors . This means that the true cause of the cytopathic effect upon the cells is not known , it could be researcher induced , by the very procedure itself . 5 . In the context of the previous point , there is no control being used whereby the experiment is duplicated at the same time with a placebo solution to see if the same cytopathic effects are observed without a nose , mouth and throat sample . This will reveal that the effect is being produced by the experimental procedure , not the the sample which is alleged to contain the disease causing virus .

Is this the kind of America Last \" leadership \" that grassroots conservatives want if Republicans take back Congress in November ? McCarthy told a CNN reporter on Monday that it was \" appalling and wrong \" for Republican Reps . Marjorie Taylor Greene , R - Ga. , and Paul Gosar , R - Ariz. , to speak to the annual America First Political Action Conference , or AFPAC . I have personally addressed and supported AFPAC since its inception in 2019 . It is the authentic alternative to the moldy , Swamp - run Conservative Political Action Conference , or CPAC , from which a rising generation of staunch immigration restrictionists and conservative Christians are banned and blacklisted ( including me ) \u2014 while drag queens , foreign sponsors , and Big Tech titans Google and Facebook have been welcomed by CPAC with open arms . Decrepit GOP Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell echoed the liberal outrage mob over AFPAC . He railed against \" white supremacists \" and \" antisemitism , \" which now encompasses investigating billionaire globalist George Soros , criticizing powerful bankers and opposing unlimited foreign aid to Israel . ( With Southern Poverty Law Center - parroting GOP friends like this , who needs left - wing Facebook , Twitter , Google , Chase Bank and Airbnb to ban us ? ) GOP elites and CNN gatekeepers want to censure Greene and Gosar for daring to address the large and growing movement of passionate patriots who care about the sovereignty of our families , churches and country above all others . In Idaho , a liberal Republican big - business group called \" Take Back Idaho \" demanded that populist America First Lt . Gov. Janice McGeachin resign for addressing AFPAC by video . McGeachin ( who has my endorsement for governor ) retorted , \" Not a chance ! \" and condemned \" guilt - by - association \" games . On Monday afternoon , the Republican - dominated state Senate in Arizona issued a \" censure \" of populist America First state Sen. Wendy Rogers for similarly addressing AFPAC by video . The eunuchs had nothing to say about the actual violent bomb threats that were called into the hotel that hosted our conference . Instead , they hysterically accused Rogers for \" threatening \" violence because she demanded that \" high - level criminals \" responsible for COVID - 19 vaccine injuries and deaths face consequences for their actions \u2014 and that convicted traitors be forced to face the gallows . Rogers rightly refuses to fold and tweeted after the vote : \" Those lying saying I was calling for violence are false . I was calling for justice and I still do . \" Now , Arizona state GOP weenies want to strip Rogers of her committee assignments , just like Traitor Kevin McCarthy did to former GOP Rep. Steve King of Iowa after The New York Times character assassins deceitfully painted him as a \" white supremacist \" for decrying those who have turned the phrase \" Western civilization \" into hate speech . As King , who spoke to AFPAC last year and attended this year , told me Monday : \" The only freedom of speech McCarthy respects is that which supports McCarthy ... He has an avaricious lust for power . \" Texas GOP Rep. Dan \" Two Minutes Hate \" Crenshaw , whom my young friends in the America First movement exposed as an anti - free speech , pro - red flag law , double - talking phony on college campuses in 2019 , supplied CNN with more ammunition . He attacked AFPAC 's founder , 23 - year - old internet entrepreneur and nationalist activist Nick Fuentes , as \" one of the worst human beings I 've ever come across . \" \" I f \u2014 - ing hate Nick Fuentes , \" Crenshaw ( last seen bullying a Texas schoolgirl who challenged his blasphemous comments about Jesus ) fumed to CNN . \" Everybody should know they 're supposed to hate Nick Fuentes . \" And they call us the \" haters \" ?

Lets have a look at how a Terrorist act is defined according to the New Zealand Terrorism Suppression law of 2020 . Please note , this is their law . This is what THEY claim to abide by . Therefore , they must either follow it , or they are to be declared hypocrites . In order for an act to be considered as an act of terror then it must fall within subsection 2 . Quote : \" An act falls within this subsection if it is intended to cause , in any 1 or more countries , 1 or more of the outcomes specified in subsection ( 3 ) , and is carried out for 1 or more purposes that are or include advancing an ideological , political , or religious cause , and with the following intention : ( a ) to intimidate a population \" . Has Jacinda and her cronies intimidated the nation by promoting irrational fear ? ' Intimidate ' is defined as , \" to make timid or fearful : FRIGHTEN especially : to compel or deter by or as if by threats \" . Has the government made people fearful ? Oh , most certainly . Simon Dallow , Mike McRoberts . Mike Hosking and others constantly bombard people with fear - based propaganda that is based on inaccurate mathematical models that are always epic fails . Has the government used threats ? Absolutely . Many people have been threatened that if they do not take the Pfizer injection they will lose their jobs . Moreover , many workers have lost their jobs simply for refusing to take an experimental medication . Ardern also said in her war speech against against the Delta demon mutant , \" Those who have not had a vaccine in New Zealand are currently in the minority , but they are the vast majority of our cases . That is because the vaccine works but it \u2019s also because the virus is literally finding unvaccinated people \" .   The terrorism act also explains that this intimidation must bring about the outcomes mentioned in section 2 which are ; ( a ) the death of , or other serious bodily injury to , 1 or more persons ( other than a person carrying out the act ) : ( b ) a serious risk to the health or safety of a population : Multiple New Zealanders have died from the vaccine or suffered from serious side effects . Does the vaccine pose a risk ? Yip . ( c ) destruction of , or serious damage to , property of great value or importance , or major economic loss , or major environmental damage , if likely to result in 1 or more outcomes specified in paragraphs ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( d ) : Yes , many businesses have been destroyed and continue to be destroyed due to pseudoscientific health measures . Drug overdoses have increased during lockdown as well as acts of self harm . international research has shown increase in suicidal ideation among young adults , ( d ) serious interference with , or serious disruption to , critical infrastructure , if likely to endanger human life : Yes , the government has caused significant disruptions to local businesses who have had to burrow money off the government as part of the ' wage subsidy scheme ' .

In a way , that video struck me even more strongly than the first , because the economist perfectly represents today 's leftists . Taylor Lee is not an inherently interesting person . He works at the FDA as an economist , so he 's not making policy decisions about medicines or how they should be used . He 's a generic young man of the modern era . He seems to be about thirty years old ; he 's credentialed ; and , even if not gay , he 's very effeminate . He 's probably a photocopy of thousands of young leftist college graduates populating government and corporate jobs . That 's why his opinions are so important . Lee 's defining quality is a preening arrogance . He 's got a little shtick about forcing reluctant people to get vaccinated , and he 's incredibly proud of it . \" Blow darts ! \" That 's his answer . Go door to door and , using blow darts , forcibly vaccinate everyone . And how will the government find those people who need vaccines ? \" I think there needs to be a registry of people who are n't vaccinated . Although that 's sounding very [ much like Nazi ] Germany . \" We 're all familiar with the passive - aggressive trick of saying something we know is wrong and then claiming it 's a joke when called out on it . That 's what Lee is doing \u2014 and the Project Veritas undercover person , by feigning fascination , draws him out . What 's even more striking than Lee 's snarky , fascist cleverness is the real disgust he feels for Blacks . They need to get with his program , and he feels , in a totally Tuskegee experiment kind of way , that he and his fellows in the government should have the power to force them to bend to his will . And lest you think I 'm making up his targeted condescension toward and desire for control over Blacks , I 'm not . You see , Lee has very clear ideas about how Blacks and Whites rate in America : \" All of the wealthy White people are getting vaccinated because they 're educated . \" Given enough time , Lee 's going to put those uneducated Blacks into the back of a bus , or maybe into a cattle car , and force all sorts of things upon them ... for their own good , of course , because this effete ignorant - but - credentialed government drone knows more about what 's good for Blacks than anything they know about themselves . \u201d https :// www . americanthinker . com / blog / 2021 / 09 / covid _ vaccines _ are _ revealing _ the _ disrespect _ some _ leftists _ have _ for _ blacks . html ", "input": "", "output": "CRITICAL"}, {"instruction": "Labeling a text as conspiratorial when it is, in fact, merely oppositional to mainstream views, could potentially lead those who were simply asking questions closer to conspiracy communities.

Will , born July 2022 , urgently requires surgery for a heart condition . Due to his condition , baby Will \u2019s parents requested that the blood used during Will \u2019s operation be from donors that did not receive the experimental Covid - 19 mRNA vaccines . Because this information is not typically tracked during donation , Ricardo \u2019s parents took it upon themselves to find donors of the correct blood type who were not vaccinated , and who were approved for pediatric blood use according to the requirements in NZ Blood \u2019s clinician \u2019s handbook . All people have the right to choose non - mRNA vaccinated blood , not least for their children . The decision to remove Will from his parents \u2019 care is unconscionable and sends a chilling message to all New Zealanders about the State \u2019s overreach and blatant disregard for the rights of parents to make their own informed decisions about their children \u2019s health and well - being . WCH calls on the government of New Zealand to reverse this decision immediately . Had Will \u2019s medical team simply followed his family \u2019s wishes , Will would be safe at home with his family where he belongs , recovering from surgery . Instead , he is in the hands of a willfully blind governmental agency , Health NZ , that puts its unscientific ideologies before basic decency , common sense , and parental rights .

( Reuters ) The jab , Priorix , can be given in two doses and may also be a supplement for those who have already received a first dose of a measles vaccine . The manufacturer GSK is currently spinning off its consumer health care business , and is focusing on vaccines and drug manufacturing . Note : in 2017 Steven Lanka won a court case proving that measles ( as well as any claimed live virus in any vaccine has ever been isolated , therefore not proven to exist ) . He argued that vaccines are being falsely promoted as containing live viruses and the Germ Theory created by Louis Pasteur is a fabrication . He believes that the process of the body ridding itself of toxins is falsely seen as a contagious virus being present in the body , but it 's simply a purification period for a mucus ridden body which he calls Terrain Theory . Sadly Big Pharma , despite the verdict , continues to promote and bank on Germ Theory which has been proven to be a complete fallacy , since nor a single virus has ever been isolated , ever , therefore not in any vaccines . Big Pharma is currently busy changing all the older vaccines ( beginning with those in the required childhood vaccines schedule ) by adding the human DNA destroying mRNA tech to them and FDA approves them fast , so human DNA is changed and the newborns and children patented , therefore legally owned by Big Pharma , like slaves being owned by a master basically .

The World Health Organisation has blood on its hands . Utterly compromised by private interests , it is directly implicated in the greatest crime against humanity this world has ever seen . At best , you could describe it as parlous mismanagement of a global pandemic , but I would argue that continually promoting experimental gene therapies even as the adverse events racked up on its own reporting system goes rather beyond mismanagement . As mass panic about Covid - 19 spread , the WHO could have been a voice of reason . It could have acted as an impartial public health advisory , evaluating the evidence , recommending early treatments , and giving people at the very least an informed choice on whether to have these new vaccines or not . Its remit is \u2018 to promote health , keep the world safe , and serve the vulnerable \u2019 . It has failed . In a sane world , this failure would be enough to require an international investigation of the WHO and an accounting of its Covid - 19 recommendations . But we all know that sanity , at least in the corridors of so - called power , has long departed . Instead , the WHO seems to believe it has not done enough , has not wielded enough influence . As I \u2019ve mentioned previously , it now wants the power to not only call a pandemic , but to call a \u2018 potential or actual health emergency \u2019 , and then to override the constitutions of sovereign nations to force its disastrous public health policies on millions of men , women and children . Friends , we must do what we can to stop this . Some of you have commented that you feel powerless in the face of so much power . I understand , but I am here to tell you that we are never powerless . The last two years have shown me more than ever how the impact of our actions always ripples out , far beyond the field of our own vision . Have faith in your own influence . You may never know what impact that conversation you had with a friend really had , or the poster you shared on your social media page . None of us ever really knows , but we take action anyway because we feel in our bones it \u2019s the right thing to do . Our individual actions and intent for a better world pooled together make us together very powerful . Right now we are getting ready for a conference where some of the most expert and brilliant people from around the world are gathering to co - create a better way forward for humanity and our beautiful planet . One of the panel conversations focuses on the question , \u2018 How can the law serve human rights ? \u2019 . Reiner Fuellmich , Dr Astrid Stuckelberger , Professor Dolores Cahill , and several other eminent lawyers and human rights advocates will be addressing these IHR amendments directly . You are of course warmly welcome to join us for this conversation , whether in person or online . I recommend you invite your friends around and make a party of it ! By the end of the conference , we will have what we need to draw up a charter of our own , by the people and for the people . I ca n\u2019t wait to share it .

A YEAR TOO LATE . \" An Oklahoma man who suffered an injury from a Covid - 19 vaccine has been denied a medical exemption \u2014 despite being advised not to get the second shot . Jonutz 's medical insurer Accuro Health Insurance initially accepted a pre - approval for specialist consultation but declined further cover due to his policy 's pandemic clause stating \" any consultations or treatment related to avian influenza or other pandemic are not covered \" . In mid - November , ACC informed Jonutz that cover for his injury \" had not been determined \" and it was unable to consider his application . Without ACC , Jonutz continued work as a mechanic , agitating his condition and causing him to collapse at work . ACC chief operating officer Gabrielle O'Connor said Jonutz 's claim was never declined but was \" held \" while ACC sought information to determine cover . \" We appreciate three months may feel like a long time to wait for a decision . \" Ya think ? !   Honestly , if the Herald had really cared ( and did n't feel the need to act as their neck is on the line ) they would have been posting these stories waaaay back in March 2021 - a full year ago .

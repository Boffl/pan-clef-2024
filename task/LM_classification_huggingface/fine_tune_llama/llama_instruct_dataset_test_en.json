The Bill will get a second reading on Friday 6th May 2022 . I agree with Sir Christopher wholeheartedly - the Government is ignoring those injured and bereaved by the Covid - 19 \u201c vaccines \u201d and there is a need for a new vaccine injury bill . Sir Christopher \u2019s speech included the following points : \" \" No payments have yet been made . . . even in respect of those whom a coroner \u2019s verdict found to have died because of the vaccine . The impatience and frustration of those so affected is now palpable . Having lost their loved ones more than a year ago , some have been badgering the Under - Secretary of State for Health and Social Care , my Hon Friend the Member for Lewes [ Maria Caulfield ] , for action \u2014 I am pleased to see her on the Front Bench . I understand that yesterday she blocked vaccine victims on her Twitter account and today she closed her Twitter account completely . This is an indication of the strength of feeling among the public . \u201d \" \" Those who were in perfect health before their vaccine have encountered too much ignorance and scepticism when seeking medical help . For some , their general practitioner has refused to engage , to the extent that they are made to feel gaslighted , with their physical pain being dismissed or explained away as mental illness . How insulting and humiliating is that and how at odds with the principles of the national health service ? \u201d The \" \" Coronavirus vaccine - weekly summary of the Yellow Card Reporting \u201d ( https :// www . gov . uk / government / publications / coronavirus - covid - 19 - vaccine - adverse - reactions / coronavirus - vaccine - summary - of - yellow - card - reporting ) which I trust you are familiar with provides details of yellow card reports - each week more adverse events and deaths are reported . Through an organisation , UK Citizen , I am aware of two hundred and fifty ( 250 ) formal Covid - 19 vaccine injury statements been made and subsequently lodged with the police . In addition there were many more people who came forward to share their experience of vaccine injury and bereavement , but who were not comfortable filing a formal witness statement . The gaslighting of the Covid - 19 \u201c vaccine \u201d injured and bereaved must stop . The public should have been told , at the outset , that the Covid - 19 \u201c vaccines \u201d were ( and are ) experimental and remain in clinical trial . This did not happen , \u201c informed consent \" \" was consequently not possible - the Government failed the public . Subsequently , the Government used coercive methods to get the public to take the Covid - 19 \u201c vaccines \u201d in contravention of the principles of public service as enshrined in the Nolan Principles . Now the Government is failing to recognise that there are adverse effects from the \u201c vaccines \u201d - this is simply unconscionable . The Government must make the public aware of the risks involved in taking the Covid - 19 \u201c vaccines \u201d ; be transparent about injuries and deaths ; and provide care and compensation for those injured or bereaved . Clause 1(2)(a ) of the Bill provides that the review must consider the effectiveness of MHRA in the monitoring of side effects and the NHS and Government response to such monitoring - it is evident from everything stated above that such a review is vital . Sir Christopher \u2019s \" \" Covid - 19 Vaccine Damage Bill 2021 \u201d must be supported .

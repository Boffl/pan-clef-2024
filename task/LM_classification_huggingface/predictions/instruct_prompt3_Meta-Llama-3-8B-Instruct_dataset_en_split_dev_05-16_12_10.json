The text makes a baseless and unfounded claim that the World Health Organization's (WHO) Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has a hidden agenda to kill off the elderly to ensure that no wisdom is passed to younger generations. This is a conspiracy theory, as there is no evidence to support this claim.\n2.

The title \"Vaccine Poison Discovered in Vaccinated Mothers' Breast Milk After Government Said It Was Safe!\" is sensational and alarmist, implying that the government is hiding information and that vaccines are dangerous. This type of language is often used to grab attention and create fear, which is a hallmark of conspiratorial content.\n2. The use of the phrase \"Government Said It Was Safe\" is a common tactic used by conspiracy theorists to imply that the government is involved in a cover-up. This phrase is meant to create distrust and suspicion towards the government's actions.\n3. The mention of \"WarRoomShow\" and \"Owen Shroyer\" suggests that this text is part of a larger conspiracy theory narrative that is being promoted by a specific group or individual. The War Room show is known for promoting conspiracy theories and misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic.\n4. The inclusion of a call-to-action (\"Get Show Alerts, Text: 'WARROOM'\") and a promotional link to a product (\"Brain Force Plus 50% Off\") is also a common tactic used by conspiracy theorists to promote their products and services to their followers.\n\nOverall, the language and tone used"

The text does not present any extraordinary or unsubstantiated claims about the pandemic, public health decisions, or secret influential groups. Instead, it focuses on a specific issue with Merriam-Webster's dictionary definition of \"vaccine\".\n2. The text is concerned with the perceived change in the definition of \"vaccine\" and expresses frustration and anger towards Merriam-Webster's decision. This is a legitimate topic for discussion and debate, and the author's emotions are understandable given the controversy.\n3. The text does not contain any language that suggests a broader conspiracy or attempts to manipulate the reader's perception of the pandemic or public health decisions. The focus is solely on the dictionary definition and the perceived change.\n4. The text does not contain any sensationalist or inflammatory language that might be characteristic of conspiratorial content.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the text does have some characteristics that might be considered oppositional or critical of mainstream views.

The title mentions \"exposing lies\" and \"dangers,\" which implies that the content is presenting a misleading or inaccurate narrative about COVID-19 and vaccines.\n2. The mention of a \"medical expert\" without providing any credible credentials or affiliations raises suspicions about the expert's qualifications and potential biases.\n3. The use of sensational language, such as \"LIVE\" and \"EXPOSES THE LIES,\" is a common tactic used to grab attention and create a sense of urgency or drama.\n4.

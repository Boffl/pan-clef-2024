This is a common trope in conspiracy theories.\n2. The author implies that there is a hidden timeline or plan, referred to as \"it\", which is not publicly known. This creates a sense of mystery and intrigue, which is often used to engage readers in conspiracy theories.\n3.

The article appears to be simply reporting on an advertising campaign by Ryanair, highlighting the \"Jab & Go!\" slogan and the fact that the airline had previously stated that it would not require passengers to take a COVID vaccine before flying. The tone of the article seems neutral and informative, without any apparent attempt to frame the pandemic or public health decisions as the result of a malevolent conspiracy.\n\nThe article does not present any speculative or unsubstantiated claims, nor does it promote or encourage the spread of misinformation. It simply reports on a marketing strategy used by Ryanair to promote their summer flights.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided text, I would not label it as conspiratorial."

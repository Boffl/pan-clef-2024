    "response": "CONSPIRACY\n\nThe label is CONSPIRACY because the text presents a scenario where the food supply and banking systems are being controlled by the government or a secret entity, and that unvaccinated individuals will be denied access to their cash and food. The text also implies that a social score system is being developed, which is a common trope in conspiracy theories. The author's claim to work within the industry that creates and enables these systems adds to the conspiratorial tone. Additionally, the text's language and tone are alarmist and sensational, which is typical of conspiracy theories."
